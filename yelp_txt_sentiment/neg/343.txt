I have never had an experience at a car repair place where the manager was so laid back and out of touch with the customer. I was getting new pads and rotors on my VW and dropped my car off in the morning on a Saturday. When I dropped it off I was told it would be completed that day. I was told they would call me when it's ready and I told them my son would come pick up the car before they closed at 6. At 4:30, I called for an update and I was abruptly told that they would have to call me back. No big deal. Time goes by, no call back. I call again close to 6 and tell them I need to arrange for my son to pick up the car and ask if its ready. They tell me they don't know when its going to be ready? It's 6 Oclock now and you don't know. He keeps telling me he has to call me back. I tell them that it unacceptable since you close at 6 and my son is on his way. He does not tell me they are going to work late nor does he tell me the car won't be ready till Monday. At this point I am fuming at the lack of consideration and communication. I am being inconvenienced now and no answers. The manager was young and inexperienced and way too laid back to deliver bad news to customers. I would of understood if the situation was explained to me and I wasnt continually told they had to call me back. 

This after last week I had to take my sons car back there to get the bottom plastic sheath put back on after falling off while driving after getting an oil change. 

I will never go to this place again.

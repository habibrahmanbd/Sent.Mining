I had a pretty negative experience here.  I was told that my design was "about the worst design possible," which was condescendingly explained as being because I wanted it to have a circle in it, but "the human body isn't flat."  Really!!! The human body isn't flat!  No way!  I'm pretty sure I've seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.  I have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicated as the design I brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.  I appreciate that the artist I talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it, but given that there are about 100 other places on carson to get tattoos I was surprised that he was so rude.  I definitely would have been thankful for expert advice about how to improve the design, but we didn't get anywhere by him simply deriding it.  I also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful, but my previous tattoo was done by someone much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.  

In the end I'm glad that I didn't get tattooed here, because I wouldn't want someone that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.  I give them two stars instead of one though because the place was very neat and clean, and the example art on the walls looked pretty good (but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated, if not more so, as what I wanted but was refused).  I guess if you really don't care how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty, it would still be an ok place to go.

RUN RUN RUN!!! This is a sham up one side and down the other!! We rented an economy car, like we have 40 times (we are locals). We prepaid through carrentals.com. It CLEARLY STATES on the agreement...UNLIMITED MILES.....I drop my husband off to get our PREPAID RENTAL CAR from EZ SLEEZY CAR RENTALS OF LAS VEGAS! When hubby gets to the counter...GUESS WHAT...she said YOU ARE LOCALS... you need to bring a bill from home to PROVE WHERE YOU LIVE...and you only get 150 miles per day and you need to pay a big fat deposit and and and..IT CLEARLY SAYS ON CONTRACT....unlimited miles...paid in full...The rude B$TCH at the counter was a horrible wench with a horrible attitude...she was just a nasty person.So my husband walked over to HERTZ...rented a car....paid and because it was in person they did a 200.00 hold (which is fine) it was 20.00 more for 1 day less than EZ SHIT HOLE NASTY CAR SCAM NOT RENT AL. Then on the contract it says NO REFUNDS NO MATTER WHAT....   SERIOUSLY!?  They broke the contract but changing ALLLLL the terms As a local...THEY ARE VERY PREJUDICE TOWARDS US...and we are a "disabled vet marine" and a "business owner" with a "5 year old child " with us. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE..what glitter here is NOT GOLD...it is lie steal and cheat the customers...GO TO ANYWHERE other than this rip off place...what a freaking NIGHTMARE!!! If you are LOCAL....DO NOT COME HERE AT ALL!!!  If you purchase online...DOES NOT MATTER you are screwed...plan on getting a car somewhere else and plan an additional chunk of money you wont have for your vacation!!  RUN RUN RUN..unless you like the run around , getting ripped off and having nightmares. We have used all the other companies there....this is the ONLY ONE we had a problem with...it was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  This rental was April 2015

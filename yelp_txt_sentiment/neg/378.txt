Sadly, you have need to come here unless you have a specific reason to be here, or you like looking at abandon shops inside of a small mall.

There are a handful of stores inside and a school- you know your mall is failing when it becomes a church or a school. There are a few bars, but nothing major. Again, I feel like only people staying at the hotel next to it would visit here only because it's so close.

Now there are a few other restaurants outside of the mall like The Hard Rock Cafe and Texas De Brazil, but nothing really catches your eye as a place you really want to stop at.

The Ducky Tour begins and ends there so there is that. What's sad is the area itself is kind of nice. They installed that beautiful fountain that plays to music, like the Belliago in Vegas, but with much less flare.

It's upsetting because this could be an amazing place, but it just isn't. You don't need to come here if you're visiting, spend your time at more interesting places because there are a ton in the city.

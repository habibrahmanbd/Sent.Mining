My husband and I were really looking forward to this dinner. What a huge disappointment. My husband got the filet. It was tender but so over-seasoned it was hardly edible. The French fries it came with had about 10 times the normal amount of salt. I ordered a fish called bream and I could only eat a few bites. It was soaked in butter and covered in capers (which the menu did not state) and once again it was too salty to choke down. The brocoli was over salted as well. I generally love sea salt....but this was crazy over done. I guess the chef must have been back there getting his frustrations out. The tomato salad was excellent and the service was good. Don't waste your money at this expensive restaurant!

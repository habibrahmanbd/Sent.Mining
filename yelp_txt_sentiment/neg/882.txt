Most disgusting biryani I have ever ate in my life, first of all it's not biryani, they mixed some pre cooked rice with pre cooked lamb curry and added some spices over it, what's funny is the name of the place is biryani... ! Either they should change the name of the restaurant and remove biryani from menu and name that as yellow rice and lamb curry. I spent $17 for that yellow rice. I'm not coming here for sure, also tell all my friends never to go there. I wish yelp has negative stars I would have given negative 10. I bet you can cook better than what they are serving here. So watch out guys

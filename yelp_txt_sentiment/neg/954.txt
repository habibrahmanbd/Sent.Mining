What the heck has happened to this place!!??  There obviously has been a conscious decision to just let this place go. The interior is in need of a renovation, the associates rarely say hi or offer help, many not friendly, many homes where product goes is empty, broken displays everywhere, missing price tags, the counters at check out and return look terrible, the place is dirty, foot traffic is way down, many off brand products, flea market toys and junk for sale up front, etc. This used to be my first location location I'd  go for any electronics, now it's the last!!!

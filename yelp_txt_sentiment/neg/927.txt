The food is VERY average and not worth the price. The drink specials are great, but the service, the service is absolutely atrocious. I've been here 3 times and it always takes forever to get the food (which isn't the wait staffs fault) and to get the check (which is the wait staffs fault). Last time we went there, and it was the last time ever, it took our waitress 25 minutes to pick the check up off the table and return it. It became a running joke at our table of how long it would take her. To be fair, I can understand this type of wait when it's busy, but we noticed that the waitress only had 3 tables at the time. Trust the reviews on this place and go to another Mexican restaurant in south end.

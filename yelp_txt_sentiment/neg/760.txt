MEH:
They are on the right track but definitely have some kinks to work out. A few issues aren't their fault. The ticket line moves slow. However that's because people have a hard time choosing their own seats. The staff isn't the friendliest . The seats are the biggest disappointment.  You can't recline your seat without raising your legs. That needs to be 2 separate controls. PLUS  you still have to SHARE an armrest with whoever is setting next to you. At A.M.C. the seat are noticeably more comfortable.
You're definitely better off saving your money and just going to Gateway or Parkwest.

Yesterday I took my husband to eat on his birthday.  Both the food and service was horrible.  I ordered a steak and they brought me out fish.  The server immediately removed my plate and let the chef know of the error.  The server said the steak would take 14 minutes to cook.  By then my husband would be done eating his meal.  So I sat there watching my husband eat his meal.  My husband ordered the blackened halibut, I took at bite and the fish was very dry and burned around the edges.  I tasted the carrots and the they were not cooked all the way, they were still hard.  The baked potato was the size of a roma tomato and it was also dry.  What a waste of time and money.  I spoke with Marie the manager and she came across as not caring and let me know that my steak was removed from my bill.  I would have been very upset had she charged me for a meal I did not eat. She didn't do anything to have me want to come back.  Save your money and go to a more reputable restaurant that knows how to serve delicious meals.

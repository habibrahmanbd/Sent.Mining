Stopped by yesterday to try out as I have a store near here. Store is new and clean with plenty of help in kitchen. Customer ahead of me made order and girl on cash draw had to go in kitchen for help. Then when my turn she did not know what was even on their menu board, had to go in kitchen again to get clarified. Made my order for some wings , paid for them then she told me it would be 18 minutes. Told her I was not waiting 18 minutes for wings. This brought another trip to kitchen.came back and told me they could do in 8 minutes. Decided wanted my money back instead, which caused another trip to kitchen. Manager came back and refunded me. Went next door  and got my usual wings in 5 minutes. 
  Do not mind waiting some but have problem with putting people on cash draw that are not trained.

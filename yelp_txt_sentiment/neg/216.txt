The staff is very nice and helpful but there pricing sucks!!!!! Very over priced. I went with my wife and my sister and brother in law, we all wanted to get tattoos. I have 6 so I am fairly familiar with tattoo pricing. Long story short why wife wanted a small piece that should be around $75 to Vegas price maybe $150. They wanted $350 bucks! They must be joking right my piece that should be maybe $150-200 they wanted $750. The point is that they apparently think that the ink is liquid gold or something.

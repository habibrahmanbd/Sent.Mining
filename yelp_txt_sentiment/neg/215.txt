I will never rent from Budget Rent A Car, again.  I got totally ripped off by their employee at the Phoenix Airport location on 5/3/18.  He added the fuel surcharge of $40+ to my bill, despite specifically being told I didn't want that, I would fill the car up with gas myself before returning the car.  He also told me insurance would be $30, not specifying that it would be $30 + taxes for each day I had the car.  When I asked how my $61 booking (on Costco) became a $200+ rental, he told me "Arizona has a lot of taxes".  Given that it took so long to wait and then for him to prepare the contract, I did not read everything---I had my 87 year old father in a wheelchair with me.  When I complained to Budget later, I was told, sorry, you signed the contract.  Shady, shady business.

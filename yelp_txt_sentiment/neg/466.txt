We arrived during the mid-day Beat the Clock Happy Hour. Our waitress took about 10 minutes to take our order. I ordered a margarita. She forgot to ask salt or no, so I sent it back and asked if I could have one no salt; she just wiped the salt off of it. We had ordered 2 appetizers, but they came 20 minutes in between. We asked for the manager & the waitress became nicer. I felt like the length of service was designed to avoid "Beating the Clock".

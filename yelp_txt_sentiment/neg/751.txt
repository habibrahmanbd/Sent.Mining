The food was literally not fit for consumption, the chicken I was given was grey, and didnt even have the decency to cover my chicken katsu with the sauce It was desperately missing. Fifteen dollars for a plate of awful fried chicken sitting on top of some measly pieces of lettuce with no rice? If you like over priced food that might kill you if you eat it, this is the place for you!

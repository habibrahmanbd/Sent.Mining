Due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on google I decided to get a quote for a new AC, coil, furnace and duct work.  The quote was fair; however, not the best and so we chose another company. I sent an email thanking those companies that had bid on the work, while letting them know we were going in a different direction.  

That evening I received an email from the sales person stating that the company, my wife and I, had chosen didn't pull permits or have inspections completed.  He was correct that this is illegal; however, he researched the wrong company and thus slurred an honest companies name. 

When I called One Hour Heating and Air to notify/complain, I left a message reporting that one of their staff members had acted in an unethical manner. They are yet to return  my call. This is not a company I will EVER use.

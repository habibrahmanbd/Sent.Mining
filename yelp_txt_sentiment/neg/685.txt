Unfortunately, I am going to leave a negative review on the reservation and check in process. The reservations were made with this motel by calling them direct. We made reservations days ago for arrival today (Friday) making my reservation was frustrating because I was transferred a few times to different people and I was asked my name multiple times. Up to 4 times by the same person and on top of that she was rushing me because they were "in a meeting". Upon arrival to the motel I was told my reservation had been cancelled because my reservation was "not guaranteed" and I "failed to arrive before 6pm". Mind you, we arrived and got to the front desk at 5:20pm. We had been here on a previous occasion 2 years ago and it had been a pleasant experience. For the next trip to Phoenix, we will find another motel to stay in.

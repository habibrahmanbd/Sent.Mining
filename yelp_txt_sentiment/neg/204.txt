I went in to have car detailed and they told me it would take an hour, as I was walking away the attendant said oh, maybe an hour and a half. So after an hour and 15 minutes I asked for a status update and they told me another hour!  They have you held captive because they are only part done with each piece. I quit going to them for oil changes for this very reason...unable to deliver as promised. Won't be going back for anything except my floor mats which they didn't get put back.

I recently moved to Aurora from Texas and I always get my nails done every 2-3 weeks. I walked in into this nail salon as it's near to where I'll be staying to talk to the people in there to explain to them how I get my nails done   and to see if I could make an appointment for the next day. 
1. When I walked in no one acknowledged me
2. A guy asked me to walk over to him to talk to him. I thought that was rude because I personally wouldn't want anyone inquiring about their nails whilst I'm getting mine done. He could have excused himself or told me to wait for a few minutes so he could talk to me.
3. When I told him I had a picture and wanted to show him if what I wanted done was something he could do, he rudely said "well we have over 250 nail polishes, you can see if we have those colors." Like really?
I then politely asked him if he could replicate the picture I had to which he rudely responded "probably not" no eye contact, no regard of me whatsoever.  Needles to say I walked out thinking how rude! I will NEVER set foot in this establishment to spend my money in there. 
Very poor first impression. Extremely rude guy I spoke to. First impressions are everything to me and to most customers. Don't go there unless if you want to be treated like a second class citizen.

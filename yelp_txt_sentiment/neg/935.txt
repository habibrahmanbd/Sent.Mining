This shop advertised on Groupon but the lady said they can't take appointments until next week.  I feel they should say that on groupon in their add.  

I will have to get a refund now from groupon and they have lost a local would/could be customer.  

Meh, so many shops in town to spend money at.
Guess I will buy this somewhere else as a gift.

Update 5 minutes after leaving this review:
So, the owner (Vanessa) called me and we spoke about this situation.  She advised me if there was a cancellation tomorrow she could get us in or Tuesday for sure.  She also called my mother and told her she would call her next week as well.

Vanessa was nice, explaining she is a mother of 4 and last time they ran this add they had the same problem.  She said they had over 300 groupon purchases.  So, knowing this is a reoccurring problem as an owner I would state that in the Groupon advertisement.   

She did call me after hours to try and speak to me the first time but I couldn't understand her due to the spotty cell coverage as she was driving.  So, if I misunderstood her my apologies.   

I am still trying to get a refund through Groupon as I wanted to get something done for my mother tomorrow.  We will see what happens.

I will give her another star because she called again but I still feel mislead by the advertisement not saying they may not have openings for days out.  If I had seen that I would have known what to expect.

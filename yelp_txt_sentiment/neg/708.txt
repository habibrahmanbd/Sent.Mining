Went to snug harbour for a 7 pm reservation and were told we had a hour wait. Asked to speak to the manager and he rudely told us if don't like it to leave.!!!  Had oysters that were off.  Drinks never came. Needless to say we would never go back.  Btw. Watched the hostess taking tips which bumped us down the list.  Very expensive fish and chips. !!!!

While the quality of the ingredients are pretty good, and the presentation of the food is pretty good, this place just falls down for a couple major problems.

1. Speed. Went there for breakfast recently and the it took entirely too long to get my food.  I'm trying to sneak out of work to grab a quick sandwich and instead it turns into my lunch break.  There were no other customers in the place ---- the name of the game is to get people in and out. ESPECIALLY DOWNTOWN!!

2. Generosity of the ingredients.  The roast beef sandwich was all bread and very little meat.  I don't mind paying $9 for a sandwich, but it better be good and fill me up. They had only one or two measly slices of roast beef.

For these two reasons, I won't be going back any time soon!

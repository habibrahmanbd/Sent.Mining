Why are there no pre made flower arrangements??? I had to buy 3 packs of flowers and then a vase and attempt to make my own arrangement. No bow. It looks so tacky. Thank you for wasting my time Fry's. I was in a rush and chose to stop here, lesson learned. I will drive the extra 5 blocks to Safeway!

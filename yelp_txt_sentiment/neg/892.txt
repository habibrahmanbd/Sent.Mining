I would give them zero stars if that was an option. I submitted a claim on damage done to my car in transit. My bumper is literally taped on at the moment because of the damage they did and they have no sense of urgency in getting back to me as to what's going on with the claim. It's been 4 weeks since I submitted the claim and no one will call me or email me back.  This place is a black hole. The name "Dependable" is a joke.  Some of the worst customer experience ever!!

I should have kept my reservation at the other hotel, but my friends event coordinator told me they had rooms blocked here, so I booked. 
It is a fine place to stay, but definitely needs improvements. 
Pros:
-Nicely done property, well kept gardens and grounds
-Nice staff, pleasant
-Kind of funny decor, like a wacky haunted house. Nothing wrong with it, it is pleasant enough
-Plenty of parking
-Spacious gym with lots of options
-7 minute drive to town



Cons: 
-The guy with the leafblower comes blasting by at 9am. I'm from CA so it was 6am for me and it's a terrible sound to wake up to. They should do this kind of loud stuff in the afternoon
-No bellboy to help with bags
-Continental bkfst, but with mediocre items and highly processed foods: yogurt full of sugar, Kroger-type croissants (you can smell the chemicals in them), half and half in the plastic cups, cereals full of sugar. I had some "homemade granola", but I question if it were really homemade b/c it too, tasted like chemicals. I'd expect something a bit more classy and better quality for 180/night. I just ate the fruit & went to town to find bkfst. 
- The toiletries smell like Pine Sol
-No bathtub in our room
-The TV reception is very poor. Kept going out and static - We really coudln't watch a channel for more than 10 mins without it going on the fritz
- They want you to pay for the gym per day. I find this insulting and tacky. I think it's 7 or 8 bucks a day. 

Overall, it is fine if you're in a pinch. Not that I go to Cleveland very often ever, but I would choose not to stay here again, only because it really needs some updating and attention to details. If they improved just a few things, it woudl make all the difference. It is too expensive a price point for what you get.

Truly horrible service to both the dog and the human. My dog loves to play around and is energetic (I wouldn't say any more than normal). The first couple of days were good but it went down hill once I bought the package. That's when I saw that they wouldn't pay attention to him and would put him on "time out" just when they didn't want to deal with him, this seems to be a common practice for them. They don't care about the dog, they forget to take them out, and forget to give then medicine when they need it. Take your dog literally anywhere else. You are paying to have your dog crated all day.

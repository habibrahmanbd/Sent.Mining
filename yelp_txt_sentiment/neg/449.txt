I've been to Honey Salt many times. I used to enjoy this place very much. I feel like Honey Salt was much needed to the Summerlin area. The last 3 times I've been there the waiters are lacking in customer service and never wait on you (no asking how your food is or if you need anything). I feel a SNOBBY vibe when I go here now and before it was very comfortable. The food is NOT CONSISTENT. I've had the scallops when they have been amazing and I've also had them when they have been rubbery. Whenever I order the grain power salad it's never consistent in portion size, the last time I took it to go, it wasn't enough food for a child, also the dressing sometimes has no flavor. For the prices they are charging (And NOT ORGANIC) I at least want my portion size to be consistent and the flavor to be amazing every time. I've also seen many times waiters or a random person garnishing the food with there bare hands and I don't think it's sanitary.
I will give Honey Salt another try, but not for a while.

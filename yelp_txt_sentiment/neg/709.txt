I've been here many a times for breakfast and it's good. However, today we sat on the patio for about 20 minutes without any of the many, many wait staff even acknowledging our presence. The wiener dog mutt friend was with us, but he was behaving amongst all the other patio dogs. It felt like we were actively being ignored when all we wanted were some eggs. After numerous meals here, this very much soured the experience. So strange. 

Update: Went again for dinner, and even though the food was good the service was yet again verging on terrible. Sigh. I want to like this place, but it's gone off our rotation for good at this point.

Stopped in for a few items. I searched the tortilla section and could not find the Mission street tacos in flour, only corn. So I got the fajita size instead. The expiration date was about a week out. Made some breakfast tacos and the tortilla tasted a little stale. What a disappointment. On the other hand, the O Organics animal cookies were delicious.

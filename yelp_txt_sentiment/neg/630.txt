Been wanting to try for some time so planned to meet a friend for lunch. Interesting location and set up but food was underwhelming. Had the pulled pork sandwich combo. My bun was so soggy I had to eat sandwich with a fork although my friend did not have the same issue. Shoestring fries were limp - I like them crispy. The mayo "Cole slaw" was basically cabbage and mayo - rather boring. For the money, I was disappointed but checked it off the "must visit" list.

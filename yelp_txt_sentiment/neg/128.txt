They worry about their therapist but not their customers. I've been going on here for awhile and one time I missed and forgot about my appointment they charged me $60. They said that's the least they charge. Normally it's full price of your service. If it was so important not to miss an appointment why don't they give an automated text reminder within 1-2 hours of appointment like other places???

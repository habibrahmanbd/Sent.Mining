PLEASE. Read this before you buy a session with her. About a year ago I bought a groupon here and having a horrible experience I've never used groupon for services again.

You get what you pay for - and in this case, less. Lesson learned.

She uses clumps of lashes that fall off within 12 hours. Your eyes will also be completely bloodshot from whatever glue she uses. I let her know and even sent pictures of my eyes because they were so red and painful I thought they were infected. She blamed it on me and offered to "fix" them for more money. I declined - there was no way I was letting her do any more damage. I have had my lashes done before and since with professionals and have never had that happen. I love the lash service at wishful winking and the spot in Liberty village. 

Icing on the badlashes cake: she was over an hour and a half late for my apt and claimed it was never booked. even when I showed her the text she had sent me with the confirmation.  The whole time I was waiting my gut was yelling NO and I should have listened.

Just no.

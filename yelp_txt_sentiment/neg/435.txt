I was charged nearly twice the amount for medication that I could have gotten much cheaper at a local pharmacy. Had I known how expensive Roadrunner pharmacy is, I would have requested the vet give me a prescription I could have taken to the local pharmacy in the first place. $110.35 for ten packs, vs $60.00 at local pharmacy. 
The medication is for a chronic condition, so it must be given for the rest of my cat's life.
I can guarantee you Roadrunner pharmacy has gotten their last dime from me. Anytime my cat needs medication I will see if I can buy it at the local pharmacy first, and if not, I will go to a competitor that I see advertised on television.

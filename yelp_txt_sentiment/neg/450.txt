My gf suggested we eat here because they have "better" food, which I suppose is implied by the higher price they charge for dinner. 

This is not the case. 

When you're in Vegas (or anywhere, really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet. 

Sure, they've got Kobe (not really, we aren't in Japan) beef, lamb, sushi, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab, flank steak, shrimp cocktail...

... but it all tastes like buffet quality food, which is a better way of saying they're mostly terrible. 

Do you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds, if not thousands, or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?

Where is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it's so tough your knife can't get through it?

Like king crab legs? Then you'll hate them here, since they're all machine-cut, partially frozen, and it tastes like they've been sitting in a salt water bath for a week. 

I wouldn't even mess with the sushi. I'm very, very picky about my fish, and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store. 

Even the desserts were mediocre. 

If you want to eat well in Vegas, go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you'd spend here there. This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they're serving or charging, nothing beats paying for freshly made food. It isn't worth cramming sub-par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here. Unless you have no discerning tastes, or you're just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey, no judgment here... do your thing) then this just isn't the place to waste money in Vegas.

Oh boy. I love giving proactive reviews but this place has made that hard. Sadly I live nearby writhing in pain having to be so honest. Premium pricing with poor execution. The good - prosecco cold, server kind and considerate. The bad - bills couldn't be separated, pasta with seafood was strangely citrus and unItalian. Pizzas bland, calamari average with a strange paste base. Server did not know menu items to recommend. 

Overall - the place has a great setting and almost everyone we know including us find it has been consistently poor value for what you pay. 

Needs help.

There's really nothing special or noteworthy about the Village Idiot. Except that you must be one if you keep coming here. Sin and Redemption (same owners maybe?) is literally around the corner with the same menu. Village Idiot has no air conditioning, so be prepared to sweat on a summer day. Even with the big windows opened, you will be sweating. The food isn't bad but it is a bit pricey for bar food.

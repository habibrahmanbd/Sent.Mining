Well, it arrived, I can give them a star for that... I ordered using Eat24, and I'll give credit that it came earlier than expected. That being said, I'm kind of shocked that it wasn't hot, barely warm even.  I also selected the spice factor at very spicy, as high as it could be, and this was so bland a toddler could have eaten it. it bordered on sweet even.  I ordered Gen Tso tofu and garlic tofu, lunch and dinner, if you will.  After one was cold and bland I sampled the other, just in case.  The 2 were virtually interchangeable.  Only difference was the garlic sauce was thin and not as congealed as the Gen tso's.  I paid extra on one dish for lo mein, and the amount was not worth it in comparison the the rice that would have been included.  The veggie spring rolls were mush inside.  Over all I was completely disappointing and will stick with Emperors palace or Ty Fun when I need my fix.

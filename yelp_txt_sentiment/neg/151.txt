Always slow service. They don't always have what you initially wanted and then they mess that order up, too. I come  here because of the proximity but I think I'll just make the drive out to a different Starbucks from now on. I agree with some of the other reviewers, the coffee is weak and the parking/drive thru  set up is hell. Overall  not worth going to this location.

I did not visit the Kent office, but the office of Dr. Brown in Fairlawn. She was lacking in compassion, clarity, kindness, and professional ethics. She judged me based on my  pharmacutical history, and did not even glance at the stack of medical records I brought with me. I have been treated by some of the best in the country at John Hopkins and Walter Reed, and to be treated so unprofessionally in this office was an insult to the profession. Do NOT waste your time with Dr. Brown!

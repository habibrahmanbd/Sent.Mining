Price: Medium price range. ($11-13 for a burger).

Taste: I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Bliss burger with a side of mixed green salad. The meat tasted like cardboard and it was very dry. The salad had too much salad dressing. I was surprised that they poured the balsamic dressing onto my salad (not mixing it) as opposed to having it on the side like other restaurants. 

Atmosphere: The decoration was nice and the place had a relaxing atmosphere. It was clean overall.

Service: Great service. The waitress and manager checked on us frequently to see if we needed anything. 

Overall: Unless they improve on the quality of the dishes, we are unlikely to return.

I agree with Ashley - the furniture looks nice (1 star), their attention to customer service is horrible (0 stars).

My wife purchased an item off the floor and ordered 2 others.  After she spent over $5K in the place she was informed that NO ONE in the store would help her load the heavy object into her car - she had to solicit another customer as a volunteer while staff in the store sat and watched.  Strike one.

Our item arrived (dining table and buffet) but the buffet was missing shelves.  We called the store to resolve and the person on the phone stated "I'll check into it and call you right back" then hung up without taking our name or any other information, so it was obvious he had NO intention of resolving the issue.  Strike two.

We called customer service and the store again and were told the item would be sent to us via UPS later that week.  After additional calls to the store, THREE WEEKS later they arranged for their big delivery truck to deliver two measly 16 inch X 22 inch shelves.  When the delivery man came he only had ONE shelf and no shelf supports to actually load the shelf into the unit.  A trip to the store to resolve this issue was met with a careless "we'll have to order the shelf supports for you."  Strike three.

My advice - stay away from this place.

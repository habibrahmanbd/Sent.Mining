Horrible! currently at the drive thru. Been here for 25 minutes. Once I finally get to the mic, "teriyaki chicken will be an 8 minute wait". I've been to the drive thru 4 times and on 3 occasions there has been an 8 minute wait for teriyaki chicken. This place never fails to disappoint. I'm from Tucson, AZ and all of your establishments are just fine up there, why not here?

We called in advance to see if an item was in stock, was told there were three.  When my husband got to the store, their inventory still showed three in stock.  They couldn't locate any of them.  Said they were on the display beds.  Really???  A CALIFORNIA KING MATTRESS PAD on a display bed?  Too many people with no clue.  What a waste of time!

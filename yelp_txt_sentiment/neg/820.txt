Just stayed last 2 nights. Been there 3 years in a row. ( Barrett Jackson) Hotel cutting back. Coffee in room $4.00 a cup- joke. Burn hole in comforter and ripped bed skirt  No turndown service any more, service at pool SLOW and pool so over crowded. This is my first review, but felt people should know the rooms were $500 night on 8 th floor over HVAC units. Service at front desk and concierge was also not helpful.  Overall there must be better hotels and service in Vegas. Too bad as we have always enjoyed this property

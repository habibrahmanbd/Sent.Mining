waited almost a month for a microwave because the cabinet spacer was unavailable, turns out the reason it was so hard to get is it was the wrong spacer for a different appliance.  Add to it the very unpleasant woman at the register that the sales guy passed us off to.  Add to that they didn't call when they flaked on the first delivery, called 1/2 hour into the window the second delivery to say they are going to flake,  the third time took all morning at my house to find out the unpleasant girl and appliance guy were unable to match the right spacer with the right appliance. 
 
To the manager at best buy,  my time is valuable.  Your inept handling of sales have wasted hours and hours my time, and your staff could really care less.  The only gratification is to know that you lost money on this non-sale and you still have to pay the installer.

I learned a good lesson though, why would customers go to your store when we can buy  online easier and more accurately and skip the ugly attitude from your staff?    If (probably when) your store goes broke and then closes you shouldn't be too surprised.

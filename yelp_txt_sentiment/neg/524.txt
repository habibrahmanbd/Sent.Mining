Went there last night but they were closed. Not sure why because it's suppose to be 24/7. It was late night though (2am) so maybe they were doing a reset or something.  I'll never know because the employees inside never acknowledged my existence (they saw me, I know they saw me)
I go here from time to time because it's on my way home from work. The customer service is usually very good although the lines are usually long, 2 cashiers & self check are all that's open.
Do not get the sushi, it's never been fresh any time I've gotten it. The sandwiches are good though. The prices are high but they have great sales if you have a vip card.

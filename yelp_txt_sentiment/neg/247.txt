I tried to treat myself for going to a four-star hotel but it seemed they were holding back on basic amenities and proper service unless you would buy into all the atrocious add-ons that they suggested. No breakfast, no wifi, and when I got into my room all my lamps, TV, phone, etc. were either plugged off or on a timer so that they could save money on electricity. I found this out because I wanted to call guest services to let them know the TV wasn't working, and realized in short succession that the phones weren't working either. That's not just an inconvenience, it's a safety hazard!
I had to ride the elevator and walk into the lobby with my slippers, with people glancing at me. I had to stay that way for a LONG TIME, given that I could not find a single person to help me in that big hotel. I ended up having to walk outside to the streets, where I finally got a valet to go inside, call a manager, and waited out my final few minutes while she finally found some time for me. 
Four star hotel. Really? Nice place, clean sheets, but unfortunately an unpleasant experience.
Great location though.

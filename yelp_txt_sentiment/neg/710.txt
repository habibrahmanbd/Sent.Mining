I bought bean sprouts from here. First off, they have these in the back and the owners themselves select and bag them to order. I came home and the entire bag was heavy and soaked in mildew. The bean sprouts were bad. They charge by the weight. Im disgusted that they sold me bad bean sprouts and charge me more bc bad bean sprouts weigh heavier. Health department please visit this location asap!

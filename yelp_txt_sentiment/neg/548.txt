This buffet is crap if you eat here at least once a day, which we did for 5 days during our stay. Lunch is basically leftovers from the previous night's dinner, but guess what, the menu never changes! It's the same stuff every day. However, one day, there was NY Steak straight from the grill, but the price per person shoots up to like $40 (not worth it for just steak and the same stuff). One extra star for the frozen yogurt at the dessert area, which I never got sick of.

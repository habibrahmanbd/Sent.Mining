Tacos were good, service was good. Neither were great. I've been here twice and I like the tacos and the sauce caddie. Oh my god why did you rate it so low? It's a Mexican restaurant and they had nothing spicy. Nothing. I asked and I was greeted with a shrug. I asked other employees, another shrug. " you mean you have no spicy salsa, sauce, nothing spicy!!!" " no sorry sir this is Scottsdale". I'm not a spicy freak to be clear. They don't have Tabasco or anything even close to being hot. They have  "habanero oil". When I asked if it was hot the sever told me "only if you think vegetable oil is hot cause that's what it is" she was telling the truth. Literally! I'll pass next time.

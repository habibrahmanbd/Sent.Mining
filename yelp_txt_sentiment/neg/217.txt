I'm the first to give any Starbucks 5 stars because I am usually a fan. With that said, I am not a huge fan of this location.  First of all, I am not sure if this is country wide, but they charge 70c CAD to add a few drops of soymilk to some cold brew iced coffee, which is free in the US.  Additionally, their cold brew did not have the smooth flavor of the cold brew I am used to at Starbucks.  Third, mobile ordering doesn't appear to be functioning for this store or in Canada (this may be an app limitation and not specific to this location). On a good note, the bagel was edible and they had some type of guacamole avocado spread in a container which was better than I was expecting.  Update: I did write to corporate on the fact that I was charged money to put a few drops of soy milk in my cold brew and they did confirm that this is not a correct practice to charge for tiny amount of soy milk in iced coffee.

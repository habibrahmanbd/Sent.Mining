Management here is consistently unprofessional and argumentative with customers. One especially is Tyler Sims; we aren't sure. He hides his name tag. We've witnessed this with how they have handled others complaints as well our own. Less clean than most other Harkins. It's a newer theatre but it's been run into the ground. Routine disappointment. We recommend the Harkins theatres at Park West or Arrowhead.

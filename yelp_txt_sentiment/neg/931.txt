Avoid!!! Avoid!!! Warning!!! This company will waste your time and money. Great product but they will bill you whatever they want and they will claim that you have an extended contract anytime you try to cancel. I had a one year contract for $140. They charged me $180+ every month was different. When my contract was up, they said I had a two year contract. My two years is up now they are saying I extended my contract. No such things have ever happened since I have been trying to get out of my contract. Last month I was promised this was my last month in my contract. Now they are saying I have another year or pay termination fees. They will make up anything to keep you in contract.

Checked this place out recently but was pretty disappointed.  It smelled like old people in there.  The ceiling and carpet was seriously out dated, like 1970's outdated.  Just had an old/worn vibe, so we didn't stay.  The lane area looks ok, but they should dim some of the lighting a bit, and add a few more black lights and remodel the whole interior.

Interesting food, but service was pretentious.  I guess they expect some sort of minimum order because our server actually asked us "you're going to order more right?" after stopping in for a late 9pm restaurant grazing.

The cured seafood antipasti was interesting but not amazing.  The standout dish was the swordfish belly but the portion was small.  The black ink squid ravioli was an interesting thing to do w/ bread but there wasn't much flavor to the bread.

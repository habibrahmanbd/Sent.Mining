Went out of my way to get paint at this store because my carpenter told me to buy here and get a specific type of paint. After buying 300 dollars worth of paint and having it sprayed on, I found the paint was the wrong color. They made no attempt to help in the suituation. I basically spent triple the amount of money on this paint only to have them point fingers at the carpenter. I'll go elsewhere next time and so should my carpenter.

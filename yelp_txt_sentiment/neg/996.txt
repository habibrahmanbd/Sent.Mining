Posting for a group at the bar today:  the consensus is we loved this place until recently.  They have awesome bartenders and wait staff, but when they decided profit was more important than repeat happy customers, the price of beer went up to $4/beer, they took away our $3 glasses of wines for higher end wines most of us don't drink, (the best part is that one of the NEW bottles at Total Wines is $7.97 and they're charging $8 for one glass; btw, I get wine/restaurant economics), the staff can't turn the air conditioning down to be comfortable below 82 degrees (during a Phoenix summer, when we CHOOSE to be here)  ....but they don't charge for water yet. Hard to enjoy a meal when conditions are like this.....thought this was a sports bar, not a steak house.

The coffee, here, is decent. Majority of the staff was kind and friendly but one employee ruined my whole experience. I came to sit and relax yet Kristen was rude and the most unpleasant person I have ever seen working. As I stood ordering my drink from the cashier, Kristen yelled at the other employees, said she wanted to scream, banged around machines and their products, and just insanely rude and loud. Maybe the place wasn't perfectly clean to her standards, but I just saw a conference of 8,000 people going on and the cafe was insanely busy throughout the day. Her absurd and temper tantrum like attitude is not was someone wants to hear while they are sitting at this cafe. Worst of all, I asked her nicely to make sure my drink was iced and not blended. Her response was, "obviously I'm making someone else's drink." I was shocked and upset and hope that she can figure out how to be nicer to her coworkers and customers.

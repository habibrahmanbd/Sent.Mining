Went their so wanting an awesome Pot Pie   walked in door and saw pot pies in the warmer oven  who knows how long their were their   when we got our PP  mine was barley even warm   already disappointed thought crust was blan  and  not very tasty  i had chicken PP    the potatoes were really big chunks  with skin still on  didnt finish  my PP gave rest to husband when he got to bottom of PP didnt seem like bottom crust was done  dont know if it was because it sat their for awhile in warmer oven  or just not done   I was not happy  wont be back  thought  seating area could of been cleaner   Sad I Love Pot Pies   :(

The only reason why it got one star is because you can't give it negative stars. Horrible service, food (even appetizers) take forever to get, and what restaurant doesn't even have a drink or happy hour menu?? What a joke. This place won't last long! To top it off...female bartender only stopped at male tables to take drink orders when they were empty. 30 minutes and NO appetizer or drink refill. Once the newness wears off, this place will sink FAST!

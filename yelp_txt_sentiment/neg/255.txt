Twice now they've let me down at the islington store. I ordered parts that they said they would send from the queen street store and to come in the next day. I arrive and the parts are missing or they've made an error and they never had them. No apologies. I drove quite a distance to this store. That was the last time. They are a confused bunch at the new islington store. Lots of other places to find tools.....

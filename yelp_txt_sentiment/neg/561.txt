If I could give this zero stars I would. We were staying here for our wedding reception. The first moment I tried to check in and was told they couldn't find our reservation. We were told to just "stay at home since we lived in the area". I was then told to just sit down so he could take care of other people and was ignored for 20 minutes. Eventually, we got a room by paying double even though we had a whole wedding party staying there and booked something over 6 months ago. 

Next, the bar. We stopped by after our reception (in our wedding attire), and were ignored for about 20 minutes before being told that they can't make what we wanted or much else, again with a sarcastic and rude attitude. 

Lastly, as we were trying to just get out of this place, we called down to see if we could get a valet to help with our bags. I was told to just get it myself and received no help. Happy to be leaving. 

Overall, this is the WORST customer service I have ever encountered. When you work in the hospitality business, you should NOT be rude, sarcastic and cold to your patrons, which was especially horrible considering the event. I will never stay at a hotel indigo again.

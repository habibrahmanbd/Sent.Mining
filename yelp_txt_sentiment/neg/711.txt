They are a terrible rental agency.  We were superb tenants for 18 months.  We always paid on time and left the property in NEW condition.  It's been 28 days since we moved out, and they still haven't closed out our file.  It's taking them the full 30 days to return our deposit.  Every time I call or email to ask for an update on our deposit, I'm told the property manager is always offsite at "appointments".

Got referred to this place by my HMO insurance care practitioner.  I went in there because I have pain on my arm socket and shoulder. First visit , $70 co-pay. Doctor sent me to get x-rays which I didn't need and I knew I didn't need. Second and last visit, another $70 to have the doctor look at the x-rays that I didn't need and tell me they were negative (duh, really?)  When I requested pain pills for my aching shoulder, he said I didn't need any (yeah, right, but I needed the x-rays) and to just take an anti inflammatory (he probably thought I was some druggie or something.) Then he gave me a cortisone shot, which I really didn't want but since it was an anti inflammatory, it did help, and gave me a referral for an MRI. I never got the MRI and haven't been back since because it will cost me another $70 each time I go there, which is ridiculous. I guess its ok if you're on welfare like most of their customers, but I'm not and can't afford $70 a visit. Still have the same shoulder and arm pain. Will be looking for another Orthopedic doctor soon.

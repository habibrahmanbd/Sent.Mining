One star is generous. I love paying for a large fry and getting a medium disguised as a large. Forget getting the ketchup or napkins. They can't seem to remember that for literally 10 seconds. First stop there in over a year...was desperate and in a rush. And forget calling them...the busy signal is the only customer service you will get.

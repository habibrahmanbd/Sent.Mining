I really don't get all of the hype about Sushi Rock.  Yes, it has a fun atmosphere and the sushi is decent, but I don't understand why every in Cleveland goes crazy over it.   The sushi is average, however the Cherry Infused Martini is amazing.  I  never go on half price night because unless you make a reservation, you have to hope that you can get a bar seat.   And if you go on half price night, plan on waiting for your food forever.  

It is a little expensive for what you get.  I have been to better places in much larger and expensive cities that were less expensive but MUCH better. Sushi Rock is okay from time to time, but I wouldn't say it is a must have for a Sushi craving.

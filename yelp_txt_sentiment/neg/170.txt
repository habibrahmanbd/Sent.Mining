I love Mexican food.  I live across from the Fajita Grill.  I have only been there twice (in 4 years).

As many of the other reviewers have said, the food is sub-par Mexican food.  I appreciated the complementary chips and salsa, and the incredibly unhealthy Boat Dip was pretty decent.  I had the Tofu Mexicana, which was mushy tofu and overcooked vegetables.  As hit or miss as Mad Mex can be, since it opened I have been there more times than Fajita Grill. 

It is BYOB, but when I eat Mexican I want an ice cold margarita.  They also charge for sharing plates ($2.50) and ask that you split your check prior to ordering.

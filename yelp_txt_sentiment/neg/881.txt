I went here because I heard it's famous and been around forever. I was not overly happy with my meal though. I ordered their famous meatballs and spaghetti. The food came out at most 5 minutes after i ordered it, which tells me it was not prepared freshly for me, but rather was either made en mass or sitting around. The spaghetti was sticky and old tasting. The meatballs were good. The same for the Salad, it came right after I ordered it, and it was a good salad but again, not fresh. I could tell by how the lettuce was wilting in the Salad dressing that it had been around for a while. Somewhat pricey for in fresh food too...

Pretty much the same as all of the other reviews. Can't ever get someone on the phone with customer service. The speeds are dial up slow. I can hardly make it through a Netflix movie without it buffering several times. It's unfortunate that they have a monopoly on this building. If enough people have had enough of their subpar service, they might just find themselves out of the building.

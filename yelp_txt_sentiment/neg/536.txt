My husband and/or I shop at this Safeway almost daily but we won't be using their deli or bakery anymore.  Last year, I ordered several party trays, days in advance, for a birthday party.  When I arrived to pick them up, the orders weren't ready.  As I panicked, they looked up my name and told me that my order was due to be picked up the next day and at a completely different time.  They not only got the date wrong but also the time.  I arrived at the party site (Encanto Park) at the same time as the first guests, completely stressed out, having not had any time to unload my car or decorate as I'd planned since I waited nearly 45 minutes for the lady at the deli to make up the trays on the fly (to her credit, she did give me some extra food for free).  This year, I decided to order two birthday cakes from the bakery.  My husband just called from the store and told me that they lost one of the cake orders and he was waiting for the bakery to make the cake (they discounted it by 50%).  Needless to say, we will not ever be placing any catering orders at Safeway ever again.  Incompetency is not acceptable, no matter how much you discount the price or give away free stuff.

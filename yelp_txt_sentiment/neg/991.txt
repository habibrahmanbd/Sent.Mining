Have you ever had that ill feeling that you just threw good money down the drain? Well same here... $28 wasted. My husband and I got a Patty Melt, Ravioli and Garlic Knots. Patty melt was wafer thin - for a visual, it was the size of a McDonalds hamburger - skinny and small. Why did we bother ordering it well done? 60 seconds sitting on the counter at room temp would have made it well done. Ravioli was dry and short on marinara and they completely forgot the marinara for the garlic knots. Maybe they were running low tonight??  Nothing more irritating than wasting your money on bad food.

The food is just OK. 

The menu being long without a focus was my first sign that the food would be mediocre. So I kept it simple and order the burger with bacon and the dry rub chicken wings. 

The burger was decent but for 9$ and some change, I wish I had a Five Guys burger or something of that caliber. The chicken wings were super dry like tough meat dry. I am positive the wings had been under the hot lamp for hours before I ordered them. I first thought that the meat had been dried out from being fried too long but the food arrived too quickly and was not hot enough for this to be the case.

This was my first time ordering from ClusterTruck. The only reason why I did was that I had a $10 off of $15 coupon. Plus I wanted to take advantage of the curbside service. But honestly, the burger and wings were not worth the $12 I spent after using the coupon. 

Maybe it'll be better next time but I doubt there will be a next time for me.

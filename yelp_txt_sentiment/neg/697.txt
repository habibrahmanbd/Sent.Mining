Like many other SoCal folks that reviewed this place, as much as we wanted to like it based on the other reviews, we were left disappointed. 

The menu was good, a lot of options to choose from depending on what you feel like on that day. They have a number of stir-fried, rice and noodle dishes in addition to appetizers and salads. We saw that they had papaya salad so we were excited to give that a try since you don't see that at a lot of Thai restaurants anymore nowadays. We also got yellow curry chicken, since you can never go wrong with that! ....but we were wrong ): The curry was EXTREMELY sweet and watery, chicken was rubbery and rice was dry and not Jasmine-y. The papaya salad had a bed of lettuce on the bottom, which was so strange to me. At least they used real papaya but it was also sweet and not as flavorful as I would have liked. Usually in papaya salad you can smell/taste the different flavors like garlic, fish sauce, slight sweetness from the palm sugar and sourness from the fresh lime. The Thai tea was not too bad, you can tell it's real tea, just very creamy from all the cream they put on top. Once I asked them to add a bit more tea, it was better. 

One thing that really bothered me was the fact that everything came in disposable plates/bowls.. like super cafeteria style, or as if you're at church/temple. It didn't give that restaurant vibe. I guess I wouldn't mind if I was still in college but for the price point, I think they can invest in some dishes. Overall, I thought it was ok if that's the only Thai place you have access to. As for me, I will most likely not come back if you want my honest opinion. I'm just not a fan of one flavor, which for this place would be sweet.

Normally enjoy Loco. However on my last visit, they refused us service after we had already been seated with no good reason. The manager on duty didn't even come talk to us to explain why. Real professional. All we were told by the disrespectful security guard was someone didn't want us there... ? What a great way to run a buisness! I am in the service industry, and me or any of my friends will never come back or recommend this discriminating establishment ever again!

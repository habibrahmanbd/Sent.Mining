Ordered a 16 camera in Oct 2013. With in a year the dvr died. It was under warrenty and was replaced but with a different model that was cheaper than the origional. Now this one's hard drive is grinding and has no pictures on the monitor. I called Loren and they said there was nothing the can do because the 1 year warrenty has passed. I thing that the second dvr should have been warranted for a year. I personally think a system should last much longer than a year. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR SHITTY PRODUCTS.

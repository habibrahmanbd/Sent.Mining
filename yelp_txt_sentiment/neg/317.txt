Arrived to spend some time at a bar that looked like it had a decent atmosphere after our flight was cancelled.  However my wife and I were overwhelmed by the number of fruit flies. It was bad just when we were having drinks. When the person next to use ordered some food, it became seriously disgusting. Can't comment on the food because we are going to move on to somewhere else.

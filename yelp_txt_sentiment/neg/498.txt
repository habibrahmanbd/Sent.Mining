This Petco is really overpriced. I used to go to it a lot because it's conveniently located in Steelyard, which is close to my Ohio City residence and the APL, where I foster animals. But it is so expensive I can't justify it anymore. It's even more expensive than its online self! 

Today, I needed to buy some kitten food and the store price was $13.50 and online it was $10.50.  Their "sale" items are always like .04 to .10 cents off - not worth the sign.  I now drive to the Pet Supplies Plus in Lakewood (which has much more reasonable prices) to avoid this Petco.

The workers are nice though.

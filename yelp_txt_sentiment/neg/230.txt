Bricco is a local Junction restaurant that I truly would like to support. ..but it confuses me. There is a meticulous attention to detail about restaurant decor. However in a couple of visits with friends,  one of four in the group wasn't happy with what they selected...while the other three were thrilled. Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative?
I am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine. I would have lost hope except the main was a cut of beef with an Italian pairing that was to die for!
Lets hope for more consistency and the locals will fill the room.

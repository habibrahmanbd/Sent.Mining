Setting is gorgeous, though I still prefer the "old" El Chorro versus the "new" renovated El Chorro.  While the views are still outstanding and the patio beautiful, service was decidedly lacking and the our dinner selections fell completely flat.  Disappointing and for the price this restaurant charges, I expected much better.  We'll be back....  but for cocktails only!

For the first I've ever noticed, I think I was just cheated on gasoline!

I was near empty, and just got a fill up here where 20.5 gallons were poured. Generally near empty, the max I've ever seen is 18 - 18.2, because there's reserves.

I just looked it up, and I have a 20 gallon tank in my vehicle AFTER reserves are taken into account. 

There's definitely something off here. The machines need to be calibrated properly. 

Otherwise, it seems fine. Kind of dingy for a Terrible's location. I also wouldn't use their car wash. It's the "touchy" kind that gives your car a million little scrapes, ruining the paint job, especially apparent if you have a dark car.

If they fix their thieving ways, I'd give 'em 3 to 3.5 stars. For more, they'd need a serious cleaning and update.

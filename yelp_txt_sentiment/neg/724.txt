Not worth it!!!! After getting there at 11am there was  40 min wait!! So I figured this has to be a delicious sandwich, however I was wrong!! After I ordered a bacon sandwich and turkey sausage sandwich, it totalled up to almost $19, once I went to the pick up counter I waited 10 min while people received thier order before me that were behind me in line. The lady said I dont know what happened, I received no apology!!!! I finally get the sandwiches, and it tastes like a upgraded McDonald's sandwich, I definitely can make a better one. Was it edible? Yes, its only worth $5, with a ten min wait. Do yourself a favor somewhere else like the pizza place on 3rd floor.

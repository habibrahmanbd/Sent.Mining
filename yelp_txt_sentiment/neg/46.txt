Well they definitely lost me as a customer! RC Willey here I come!

My father, who is 69 years old, moved out here from Los Angeles the beginning of this month to be closer to me and my kids. I ordered and fully paid for a bedroom set for him. They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said "Sorry we Missed you"....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily. He still couldn't get up though and crawled to get around his place until I was able to get to his place after work :(. Bottom line, they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all. I will never be back.

Service is terrible. 

There were 2 of us, the hostess sat us with only one menu. After we had to take turns to share the menu, we finally decided on our entrees. 30 minutes passed, no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave. On our way out I wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted, after which she asked "what table number were you at?" How am I supposed to know? Is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on?

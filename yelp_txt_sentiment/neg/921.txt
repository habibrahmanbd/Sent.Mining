My husband and I have both been using this car wash and were pretty happy with it. We had recently gone in there and were both disappointed.   I took my car in late in the afternoon and it seemed like the guy who cleaned the inside was in a hurry to get done and go home. My husbands truck was hurried through as well. We won't be going back.

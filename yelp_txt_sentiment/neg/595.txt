On February 04, 2016 approximately 3:45pm, my daughter was involved in an accident near the intersection of Westheimer @ Sam Houston Parkway S. The other driver, Mr. Kyle Jenkins, front driver side truck hit the front passenger side and rear of her vehicle. Houston police and Harris County police were on the scene. Both police departments determined that Mr. Jenkins was at fault and he was issued a citation for his failure to change lanes safely. It has been 7 days and we continued to get the same run around responses from progressive insurance and that is that they do not know whom is at fault and no repairs will be done until then. Mr. Jorge Cordova also told me that it could be equal fault on both parties despite having both police reports of the accident. It has been long enough to determine fault and the two police reports supports the facts! Progressive needs to acknowledge fault and pay for the damages done to our vehicle or our attorney will take over completely!!!

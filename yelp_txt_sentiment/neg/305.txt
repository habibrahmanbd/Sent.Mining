If you enjoy luxuries like electricity and running water, keep looking because you won't find it here. I can't tell you how many days the electric or water has been shut off for hours at a time. If you are looking for a place that will make your home susceptible to robbery, this is the place for you!. A few weeks ago they hired painters to come around and paint all the doors. The painters came in the morning while I was at work and left my door open to let the paint dry while I wasn't home. I came home around 5:30 PM to find the door to my apartment completely wide open. Thankfully nothing was stolen or vandalized but this just goes to show you how inept this complex  and its managers are at running a safe and responsible business. I reported the incident to management and never received any kind of response. My unattended apartment was left wide open for 8+ hours and the management couldn't be bothered to even call or email me about the situation. 

To top it off, last weekend I had to call 911 because a half-naked meth addict was trying to break into my car because she "needed a place to sleep". 3 cops, a firetruck and an ambulance ended up having to come to deal with the woman. This is the 3rd time in 5 months I have had to call 911 for drug addicts in the parking lot of this complex. 

Living here isn't only a horrific experience, it's dangerous. Do. Not. Live. Here. 

Because living here has been a complete nightmare, I am moving out a month early. It's not worth living somewhere as dangerous as this.

P.S. -- all the 5 star reviews for this place are written by the employees.

I have to say that I was just appalled by the attendants in the show. This was a very fun loud amazing show and everyone was dancing and clapping and singing along to the show. Why my self, partner, and best friend was pin pointed out as being to loud is beyond me. It's sad to say I will never go back even though the show was amazing. I felt discriminated and humiliated that they can dismiss us from a show for being too loud. I am a 45 year old woman and my partner is 55 and you are really going to kick us out like we were little kids that wouldn't behave.. I am not al all a negative person but this was way out of line and uncalled for.

Service was great. The food was disgusting. Ordered clam chowder and it was barely warm. Then ordered fried shrimp and the shrimp was not deveined. Seriously?! I'm paying $18.99 for fried shrimp with the poop vein still intact?! Ugh. Also ordered plain iced tea and it was frothy and super bitter. Definitely not at all impressed and won't be returning.

I signed up to this place because the schedule there tanning salon closed. Was told I had to sign up for 3 months and then it's month to month. Went here for 2 months, seen no difference in my tanning. The third month I paid for never going in once, making appointments is hard because they are always booked. The third month I paid never going in once, thinking okay. I paid for the 3 months contract I was told I had to sign up for then did not have to worry about contract after. 
Well today I get a bill for $460.00 dollars for what I do not know for, since I did my 3 months contract that I sign for in September. Stay away from this place. They rip you off!!!

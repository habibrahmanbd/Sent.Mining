The one and only cashier working was so slow and  chatted with every customer while there is a long line. I never seen anything like it! Shooting the breeze while there is a long line of people who have other things to do is unacceptable. With all the other negative reviews I hope they get there act together because Sephora has much better service and hate to see another store close.

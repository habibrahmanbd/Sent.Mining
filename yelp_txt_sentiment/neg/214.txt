Sucks. I'm there trying to buy texture for paint and four guys in that department are all busy bullshitting, except for the black man that is there to work and help people. Also, I bought a toilet a month ago and they said someone would contact me in two days. A little over two weeks after my son and I ended up installing it they called. One star because I had too.

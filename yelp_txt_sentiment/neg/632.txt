After reading the reviews we decided to try out this place last week. While the presentation of the restaurant is great when you walk in, it's def nicely decorated and kitschy since it's adjacent to a gas station, I'm not sure what everyone is raving about as far as the food.

Unsure of the portions we decided to split the cheeseburger and brisket sandwich. There wasn't really anything special about it as we found the brisket tough to chew and the cheeseburger just ordinary and nothing to write home about. If you order the brisket even sliced I felt I had to saw the brisket into small easy pieces to swallow and this is a task as you only have plastic utensils to do it and in a small basket. While there was a little BBQ sauce bar by the drink section, I believe that good BBQ and brisket doesn't need to be smothered in sauce to taste good. The only thing we didn't try and maybe it could of upgraded our experience was something from the dessert case. Nice and clean establishment but I've had much better.

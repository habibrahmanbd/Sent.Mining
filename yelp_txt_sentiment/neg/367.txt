Cute place. Lots of color choices. My nails were shaped and painted nicely, but my nail tech cut me, drew blood and didn't even apologize. He was hurting me when he was cutting the cuticle on one of my toes and when I asked him to stop he didn't... he ended up drawing blood. He then left me with dried blood on my manicure. Gross. I had to go back and ask someone to fix it. They were nice but made me wait and ended up not being able to fix it. They literally let me walk out bleeding and with dried blood on my polished toe, gave me polish to put on it later and let me pay full price for the pleasure. The rest of my nails look nice which I'm appreciative of, but disappointed about a bloody pedicure from a place with all these rave reviews. The next day my whole cuticle looks injured and I'm left with a decent size, gross looking scab. Oh well. I guess I'll just keep looking for a go-to pedi place. Be careful if you go here.

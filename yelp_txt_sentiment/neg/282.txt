They don't even deserve a single star but their was no other choice.

Stay far away from this unethical company if you can avoid it.  

The only reason why I've been forced to stay with them this long is because they are the only business internet service provider in Boulder City, NV.  I'm sorry to say I've been a customer for over 4 years but I'm completely dissatisfied.

They engage in fraudulent bait and switch billing tactics after agreeing to a new two year (lower rate) service agreement, my bill has practically doubled instead of going down each month for three consecutive months now.  

Nothing but a sham.  Every time you contact them, you get lost in a quagmire of confusion and disinformation and not to mention the worst customer service I've ever seen.  Some of these people and I'm talking about management are not able to diffuse an escalating issue and only add more fuel to the fire.

The company needs to be rebuilt from the top on down.  Horrible!!!

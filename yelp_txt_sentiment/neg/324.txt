I have been coming here for 3 years and I will say the high turnover rate between the doctors and the reception people is ridiculous. 
Biggest complaint - not one of the employees acknowledge you. I have to practically sit on the counter for someone to say "can I help u" I continue to come here because I have paid off my service and here is where they take care of it. I don't like the saying "u get what u pay for" I expected 100% better. 
If you don't mind being ignored or talked to like you are completely uneducated then this is the place for u!!!

Even giving these amateurs one star is generous.  What a completely horrible experience. It began when I took my laptop in to have to cooling fan replaced (which I told them when I dropped it off). The kid that took my laptop said it would "probably" be done in one day but could take up to three. When I called the next day, the brat that answered the phone smugly told me it would be three days and that I should read my receipt. Flash forward three days, I called them for a status and they discovered it was the cooling fan. (Imagine my shock) They then told me they would need to order it and it would be another three-five business days.  Now flash forward SIX more days. They call me and tell me they ordered the wrong fan from eBay and they would try to put a rush on it.  eBay? Really? Apparently I'm more technical as I ordered the part from Amazon.

Regardless... I strongly suggest you don't take anything more technical than a spoon to these third rate clown school dropouts.

I have been going to the O'Reilly auto parts store for over 5 years now on 9809 West Happy Valley Road Peoria, AZ 85383. Last night at 7:30 pm (5/6/13) my battery died yet again in my car. I purchased it from O'Reilly about 3 years ago an had it replaced about 14 months ago with a new battery from O'Reilly's. I took it out of my car and brought it in, expecting to have a quick check on the battery and replaced like it's always been.   To my dismay the employee said he needed to attempt to charge the faulty battery for 30 minutes while I waited in the store. I complained that this was never done ever in the past and he stated this is always how it was done.   Since the employee did not value my time over his, I was forced to wait while they attempted to charge my faulty battery. After 30 minutes he checked the battery again...and determined it was indeed faulty. He grabbed a new battery from the shelve and informed me it would be $55... I complained that the last battery did not last the 24 months and it was under replacement.   The employee informed me that the warranty was from the original date of purchase and prorated afterward. After explaining that he wasted over a half of hour of my time and other retailers such as Costco allow the warranty period to restart when you get a new replacement...he didn't seem to care. He actually told me, "well you should of bought it at Costco then".   At that point I took my old battery back and left the store. For a company that prides itself on customer service...I could not of been found at that store that night. I ended up purchasing a new battery at Costco. Even though it cost me more upfront, I consider it a learning experience. The employee's at that branch were not interested in service, only sales.   If truly this is the way the treat long time customers, I will find another parts supplier that treats there customers with the respect they deserve.

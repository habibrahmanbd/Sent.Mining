HORRIBLE - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! Unless of course you like shoddy work done by unsupervised hooligans who will completely disregard your home or property. Hiring this company ensures you can enjoy paint chips and debris everywhere, paint over-sprays on everything, drips in your plants and lawn (not to mention the plants trampled and crushed by ladders and careless boots) and paint stains on any concrete or paved surface . The job will no doubt take at least double the time frame promised and the crew will certainly enjoy using your front lawn and patio for their "lunch breaks" which can run from 10am - noon and be complete with food trash, crumbs, cigarette butts and a radio so all your neighbors can enjoy the sounds of Spanish music mixed with 3-5 loud Spanish speaking men who have no idea how to paint a home. (These are unsupervised hooligans after all) You can have them do bad stucco work as well! This is a full-service horrible company. You can speak daily with the "manager" who will smile to your face and then ignore your concerns, never writing anything down so it can be "checked-up on" after completion. He will never be on the job site to supervise the crew either, but I'm sure calling his cell phone will make you feel better as you see things being done incorrectly. You can even speak with the owner, a well-spoken "business man" whose "professional company" is happy to not properly do any of the job you're paying for. You will get a hearty apology and several assurances that "this never happens" and "we hope you know the kind of person I am" as if this is going to help remedy their poor performance by keeping in mind that the owner is a really great guy if you just get to know him.   You might even get a break on the price to make up for your troubles, which of course it won't.

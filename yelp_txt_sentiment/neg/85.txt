This place brings back so many memories with my family. It has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down. 

During my recent visit I noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book. I go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit. Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.

The service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event. I don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant. I was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu.

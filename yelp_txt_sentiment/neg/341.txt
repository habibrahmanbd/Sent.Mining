I booked a flight online and although my flight has "cancel or modify" option online, when I click on it, it tells me to call the airline. The wait time, gasp, is 45 minutes.... I have a full time job. I should be able to cancel a flight online. Last time I called them, I waited almost an hour and it turned out they had me call in because they wanted to sell me some promotional credit card. NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTS!

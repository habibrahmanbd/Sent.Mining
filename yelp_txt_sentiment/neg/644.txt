When I first moved in here two years ago when P.B. Bell managed, the office staff was super friendly and I felt it was worth the price. Now that Escape is under new management, I can't say the same. The grounds used to be clean and office staff was friendly. I transferred from a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom within the community a year ago. Upon inspection, the maintenance crew told me I would not be charged. The carpet was pulled up and frayed near a bedroom door and one wall had two large holes from a TV wall mount. Even still, I was told it was fine and that the carpet would have to be replaced anyway and touch ups are done before new residents move in. In the present, my lease just ended and an inspection had to be done by the new management crew. First off, Brenden was extremely rude to me while doing the inspection. He told me it was not normal wear and tear and would be at least 200 dollars to patch up the carpet. The "damages" in the second apartment are not as bad as the first. The only reason I did not fix the TV holes on wall and rug, is because I was not charged last time. Every time I tried to reason with Brandon he raised his voice at me and said there is no use talking to me I don't get it. I recently spoke to the manager Chris Carrol and it was as if I was speaking to Brendens twin. He even tried to charge me 55 for the touch up paint for the two holes on wall when Brenden said it would only be 20. He also stated that they are good friends outside of work and said that I shouldn't have made smart alec comments to Brenden. Overall, this has been a nightmare. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone and it is not worth the price. Not by a long shot. Beware the greedy management crew!!! They want to steal from residents now that everyone is moving out and no longer care to live there.

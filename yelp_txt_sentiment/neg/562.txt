I went to see Dr. Miner for contact lenses. He told me up front that my prescription type was hard to fit for contact lenses. His office staff is great and were patient to give me different types of contacts to try. I was told I needed to see Dr. Miner again. Apparently he didn't think there were any other options to try as he abruptly asked me to choose from the ones I already tried and talked down to me explaining that they would not be "perfect." As none of the ones I tried cleared up my vision, I will not be going back.

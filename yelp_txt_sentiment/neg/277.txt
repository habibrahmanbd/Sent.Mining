Bought my gear there for years, and did so up until the long haired hippy guy looked at me the minute I walked in and said rudely, " take of your backpack and leave it up front". Seriously, really. The amount of time it takes to take that off and put it on, takes forever. Am I really going to shove something into a backpack that's fastened to my back? No other stores have ever asked me to remove my backpack ever, specially some hippy long haired ass wipe. You guys went down hill fast. NEVER, ABSOLUTELY NEVER WILL I STEP ONE FOOT INSIDE YOUR STORE AS LONG AS I BREATH AIR. Oh, and BTW, I went that day and bought my helmet of decent people, AZMotorsports. Yeah it was more expensive, but they were polite, and they actually knew about the products. Perhaps the high turnover in staff is a hint of a deeper lying issue. Keep your BILT crap, and your crappy service from long haired hippy morons!

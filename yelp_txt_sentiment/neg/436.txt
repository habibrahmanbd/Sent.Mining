Stopped in today for breakfast and was so disappointed.  Not with the donuts - they are fine.  But we ordered a few other items that fell flat, and so did the service. 

Here's the scoop: avoid the "wrap" breakfast sandwich.  The contents were indistinguishable.  I ordered egg white and turkey sausage and I got egg whites with something green in them.  The "wrap" is a small tortilla that is folded around the egg thing and is somehow baked or steamed.  It was gross and inedible.  We also got a chicken biscuit which was fine, as least as good as the donuts.

Two cooladas were ordered.  Both were nasty.  What a vile drink.  And finally let's chat about the service and the condition of the store.  Filthy kitchen area; many employees, and seemed only one or two had worked there more than a day.  

I will not go back.  Hey, DD - stick to donuts or hire people who can count higher than 4

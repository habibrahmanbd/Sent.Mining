Really confused about the high star rating here...  I was actually excited for airport food due to the high Yelp reviews.  Should have dialed down my expectations?  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The rice and chicken were both really dry.  The veggies were soggy.  

Service was great, unlike some other posters, but that did not make up for the food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  

Price was right - under $10 for food with tax.

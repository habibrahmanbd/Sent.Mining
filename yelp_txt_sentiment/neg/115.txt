Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting "TexMex" glop;

Mumbly, unengaged waiter;

Clueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees
on plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us
perfunctorily for our patronage;

We're from the Texas Hill Country;
down there, we jail critters 
who serve up grub this bad,
for their own protection.

Never, never, NEVER again
(Back to Yard House for real food)

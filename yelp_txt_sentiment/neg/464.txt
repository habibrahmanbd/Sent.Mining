I was truly disappointed with Pint Central. The name inaccurately describes the selection they have of draft beers. When I visited, there were few beers available, several were tapped out. The atmosphere was not at all what I expected. For being a beer place, i expected garagey/sporty or just very relaxed atmosphere. If was more of an awkward club like feeling with blue lights. Staff were not the most friendly. I don't intend on returning. I'll make the haul to Duckworth's instead.

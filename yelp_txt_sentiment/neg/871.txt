I really only shop here because of convenience. The store itself is bright and clean, but it is a fairly small grocery store and because of that, there are certain products and brands that they do not have in stock. The items they do have are often overpriced. You really have to plan ahead and shop the weekly deals. If you don't, you have to pay the price... literally.

The staff is hit or miss. A friendly manager helped me find something once which was a great experience, but the cashiers are often unfriendly or just seem like they don't want to be there. One cashier was even dropping the f-bomb as I waited for her to check me out.

After I move out of my current apartment a few blocks away, I probably won't be frequenting this grocery store as often as I do now.

On their way to shutting down and I can see why. This place is overpriced even with the 10-30% closeout discounts plus I've never been into a Sports Chalet and had a good customer service experience. The staff always acts like they're way to busy to say hello, smile or help anyone with anything. Not sad to see this place go. Surprised they've been open this long....

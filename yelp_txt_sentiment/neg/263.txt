Buyer beware!!! If you buy a car from this place
They sell it to you as is. Meaning they don't inspect the vehichles for mechanical issues. My girlfriend purchased a car 3 weeks ago Ned's new tires oil pan is stripped out and leaking oil, cv boot is ripped, cam seals are leaking. They gave her a 1 month warranty from Edmonds that was completely worthless, the denied her claim. She drove the car back to cali and has had issues ever since

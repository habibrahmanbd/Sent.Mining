And management allowed a worker to place her stuff all over a counter and fight with me because I took a picture of the garage sale going on in this restaraunt. This girl had serious issues and if this is the management style then new management is needed to be replaced also. I paid for my shake, never drank it and went on my way. Not sure if the owners read this but they need a serious talk with the staff of this place. Feel free to contact me if you want all the issues.

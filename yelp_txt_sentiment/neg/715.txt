My experience was similar to Christi's below. We popped over to Free Range Brewing to try Joe's Doughs and Hiya was out front. I ordered the Bulgogi bowl. I was picturing rice topped with slices of thin beef in a sweet sauce. Crisp and savory meat with a sweet sauce to mop up with rice. I was thinking way ahead of myself. Instead I got clumpy, over cooked rice with chopped meat topped with lettuce drizzled with spicy mayo and a couple pieces of fluorescent pickled something. There were also cellophane rice noodles on one side...? Not at all what I expected. $9 - price isn't bad but the execution wasn't there.

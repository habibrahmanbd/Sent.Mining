Milestones on Highway 7 and Yonge used to be a Japanese restaurant and before that an Outback Steakhouse. Those businesses we quite unsuccessful. I'm thinking it's based on the location. One thing that Milestones did well was create a beautiful patio. With their daily drink specials they should do relatively well in the summertime.

So we want to Milestones on a Thursday evening and once we arrived there were no more tables available in the patio. We dined in the dining room. Our server who we won't name, wasn't that great of a server, not to us anyways. We first received our waters and my glass had black particles in water so I got a replacement. She was not giving us much attention. The experience that she was providing to us was not very engaging. As much as I pushed to initiate conversation she was not very interested in making small talk. When we received our food and started eating she did not once ask how our food was or if there was anything else we needed. Being a server in the past, I know that's the basics of what u should be asking. 

As for the food that we ordered it was pretty good. The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries. Only issue I had was the portion of fries that I received, it looked like someone in the kitchen ate half my fries before serving it. Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate. There were no complaints about the Pesto Chicken Penne Asiago. It was a good pasta dish. Overall with a little better customer service this place could have great potential. Jimstar Out!!

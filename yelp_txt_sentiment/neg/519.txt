Dumpy. For the same price you can stay at a much nicer hotel on the strip. Holes and scuff marks on the walls and ceiling (somehow). Had to force open and shut the balcony door since it was stuck. Stains on the sheets. Wi-Fi very slow and constantly cut out. Funniest part of the stay: Called downstairs to ask for a room service menu since there wasn't any in the room and they asked if I could go to the front desk to pick one up...uhhhh no the whole point of room service is being able to order food without having to leave the room. If I'm going to go downstairs I might as well go to a nicer restaurant than to eat this hotels overpriced mediocre food...

If I could give this place a half a star or zero I would. It was awful. We walked down to the grill after visiting the Museum. There were 9 of us and the place looked like it would be able to fit us. Looked empty inside. We were hungry so asked the guy standing outside if he room. He said "hold on let me check. This might be your lucky day" while looking at his empty dining room. Then starts telling other people who are waiting on a table that they were running out of food. When they questioned him on what he does have his response "what do you mean. We have a full menu" but you just said you were out of food. "No. I said we were out of fish" then the host continues to argue with the other guests. We decide to leave and he gets upset with us saying that if we stay he would give all of our drinks free.

My macbook pro recently had some issues with loading to the desktop after I attempted to update to the new system, so I brought it into the Illini Union Tech Zone asking if they could fix it. 
It took them three full days to get back to me with the diagnostic test results, which cost me $30 (non-refundable). In the diagnostic results, they claimed that my hard drive was failing and needed to be replaced for $140 and to recover data that's an extra $120, they also recommended a battery replacement for $134. I didn't have time to wait for them to order a new hard drive and have it shipped, so I decided to bring my laptop back to the local apple store and let them take a look.
The local apple store ran a diagnostic test, fixed my laptop and installed the new system for me within 2 hours for $0. That's right, $0!
Knowing that the Illini Union Tech Zone carries mostly apple products, it's honestly quite surprising to see that their technicians don't seem to be as familiar with the products as they should be? And they're giving poor, costly advice to students.
I wouldn't go back there again. BTW, I asked the apple technician and he said it would only be $100 to recover data.

TLDR: Check out other places before you come here to get your laptop/macbook fixed, the fees are outrageous & the technicians don't seem as competent.

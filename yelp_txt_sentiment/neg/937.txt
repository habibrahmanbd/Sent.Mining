This place was recommended to me by long-time Vegas locals, but I was very disappointed. I can only conclude that it's under different management, etc. The guys behind the counter were NOT helpful, and did not seem at all interested in diagnosing my range's problem. They just wanted to look up part numbers and quote outrageous prices. They just gave me some standard line about calling the manufacturer and paying $240 for a replacement part.  Turns out that part WAS NOT the problem, and I fixed the issue myself (for free) by cleaning out a valve unit (which I physically brought in to the store, and they failed to help with at all).

I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 just because they're really the only big parts warehouse in town, with a retail counter, that I'm aware of. So, if they stock a part and you need it immediately, fine. If you want some actual help and customer service, go somewhere else.

This company has the worst customer service possible. They dropped off a helpless elderly lady at my hospital instead of a nearby business. The address was clearly  written down and obviously NOT the hospital. When I called the dispatch to have them send the cab back and take her to the correct place, they refused and then hung up on me. Twice. How on earth is this company still in business.

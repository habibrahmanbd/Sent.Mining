It has been nearly a month (since jan 2nd 2013) since I signed up and asked for a return and still no notice as to a refund. I have been calling twice a week since and Debra has not ever returned any of my phone calls or refunded the money back. I don't think I will be receiving my money back :( THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS!! Don't join any of their schools In Scottadale Mesa or Peoria!!!

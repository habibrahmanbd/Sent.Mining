Ok, how do you review a place, as your daughter is in pain, it's been 2 hours now and you are stuck in the waiting room, yelping the time away just hoping that she will be next ,and you are still yelping hours later.

I can't quite bring myself to terms as to why it takes so long in an emergency room......I watch ER it doesn't take this long.  

So in my delusional state I am in right now, I just look at all the people around, look at the pace of the staff and there is just no EMERGENCY.  Why can't we just change the name EMERGENCY room to the hey let's get a bunch of people together in pain misery and sickness, and call it a circus.  I mean really, this is ridiculous.

I will provide a time frame for this ADVENTURE.

Current Time of yelping: 6:20pm. 
Waiting..........Started yelping.......

Current Time of yelping: 8:28pm. 
Waiting....... Took picture of Levine's Children's Room.

Current Time of yelping: 8:35pm. 
Waiting..........Took picture of the door we are waiting to open to call our name.

Current Time of yelping: 8:35pm. 
Waiting..........

Current Time of yelping: 9:03pm. 
Waiting.......... They just called our name......Woo Hooo.

Current Time of yelping: 9:23pm. 
Waiting.......... Just got word the doctor still has not come into the room yet...........It's just like Disney, you leave one big room, round the corner and then, yes, another room with more waiting.......so I am still waiting.

Current Time of yelping: 9 37pm. 
Waiting.......... Dr came in......still waiting.

Still here at 11:36pm.......waiting.....

My god the sun will be coming up soon!

Please anybody, is there a DOCTOR in the house.....

OK now its 12:15AM and we are headed out the door.

If you are in need of an emergency room....try Presby in Matthews, wait times were half and the folks we met at the pharmacy had a much better outcome than us.

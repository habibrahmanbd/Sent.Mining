I usually have them do a $17-20 job which is typically ok. Last week I had them do a mini detail for $99 and the job was terrible -- glass dirty, dust on console, trunk not vacuumed and door panels uncleaned. To add even more insult I paid an additional $59 for an oil change. I really don't want to have to inspect my car after a car wash, but if you use this place you have to. Onto the $3 places!!!!

Horrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own. I waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up.  If you are going to keep your customers happy , hire more staff that know what they are doing.

I'm always happy to support local businesses and was happy to see something new opening instead of closing on Mill Ave. However, Poppa Maize's popcorn is, well, how do I put this... horrible. We tried the chocolate peanut butter and cake batter last night, and threw out full bags after a couple of bites. Even my kids wouldn't eat it, and they are usually like human vacuum cleaners. The texture was like styrofoam and both flavors were oddly bitter. I don't know if the popcorn was old or if it's always this bad, but I don't want to try it again.

Hoping they can somehow fix their mistakes... sounds like they have some fans and are capable of much more than what I tasted.

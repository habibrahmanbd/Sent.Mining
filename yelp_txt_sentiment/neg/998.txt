I am really bummed, my kids and I love Guy he is fun and we are ridiculously hooked to DDD.  However, today we visited this restaurant and it was a major thumbs down, food tasted commercialized, no different than a TGIFridays.   Like if you were at Guy's house and he made it would be bomb but for restaurant food we gave it a D, service was a D- needs less to say we won't be going back. Waiters seemed forced, food took 40 minutes to arrive and our server didn't bother to check in us in between.  The Vegas fries were cold and soggy and the waiter said it's because there was a change of shift, hence the wait. well that would have been nice to know while we waited not after we got our food.  There are better burgers out there folks. Sorry Guy, still love ya

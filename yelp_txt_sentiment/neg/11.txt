Came here on a Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. My friends and I had a reservation, but it was not needed - the place was almost empty.

SERVICE: Extremely Poor

While I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. 

MAIN: Caprese Salad

The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).

MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it) 

These fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate).

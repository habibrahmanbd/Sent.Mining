I just wanted a beer and a quick meal...20 minutes after sitting down an annoyed waiter came by and took my order...20 minutes after that I still had nothing...no water...no beer...no food. The hostess approached me with a water, but I was on my way out.  I'd give it zero stars but there was a lady playing some nice music on the sidewalk.

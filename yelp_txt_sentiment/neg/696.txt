I asked for a former menu item met with no! It was a grilled cheese(cheese witch  they have,  and bacon they have, and tomato grilled cheese, they have,on grilled bread, which they have. Don't go. Not worth it. Was better before. Don't care about the games. Care about the care. They have none. Reboot I get it. Not caring about retention which is your annuity GET IT. Won't be back. Will miss you haymaker. New GM bitched about her hours.... Really. Companied  to me about your hours and can't cook a grilled cheese.... that's weak. Too bad
Sorry you have to work so many hours. I am a manager at a well known valley restaurant. It's is what it is. If you don't want to be there then don't. Sorry to the bartender who was as shocked as me.

Hands down worst gluten free cupcake I've ever had. I cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name, it was terrible.  Not only are all the other bakery's gluten free cupcakes superior to this one, but so are the grocery store box mixes like the gluten free Betty Crocker or Pilsburry. This was the first time I've ever thrown away dessert half-way through, I always finish or save it for later. The vanilla flavor wasn't the problem. It was so dry, that I had to take a sip of water with each bite because it would get stuck in my throat. If you're at Fashion Square and craving a gluten free treat, do yourself a favor and go to the Macaroon place. I'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax. The one star is for gluten free cupcakes only, as I have not (and cannot) try a regular one.

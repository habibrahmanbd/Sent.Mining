We just recently purchased a house with a pool. Being first time home and pool owners we want to make sure we are doing it correctly. I've taken my water to be tested here multiple times and each time they act as if it's a great inconvenience for them to spend a minute testing the water. 

Customer service seems severely lacking and often feels like they just want you to leave when you walk in. They don't greet you as enter and give half hearted answers to your questions. If you're looking for good service and knowledge please avoid this place. I for one will be looking for a new pool supply store.

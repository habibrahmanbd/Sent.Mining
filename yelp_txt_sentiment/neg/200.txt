Denny's food at Beverly Hills prices. 

One star is for the decor not the food. 

Worst eggs Benedict I have had in my entire life. Bacon is dry. Hollandaise sauce is tasteless and bland. Same for my other half. 
Belgian Waffle saggy. Whipped cream from 99 cent store. Maple syrup is liquid sugar with water. 
Very  dissaiponting breakfast !!!

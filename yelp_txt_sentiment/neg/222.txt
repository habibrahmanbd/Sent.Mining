Not going into great detail. But I brought my car in for a problem I knew it had. They inspected the car and gave me an astronomically high quote on repair. The staff was very nice and place was clean and neat. I simply could not afford the price they gave. After continuing to research the repair needed and shopping around for quotes I know for a fact that these guys quoted double the going rate and what I ended up paying. 

Anywho, there are a ton of great shops out there. And I'm sure these guys are good too. But I can't justify paying double.

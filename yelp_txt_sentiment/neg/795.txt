Caveat:  the comedian changes every week, so this only applies the week I was there, when the guy who voiced Roger Rabbit was performing.

UGH.  Not improv.  Not funny.  His entire act focused on making fun of the audience.  That's usually someone's opener before they go onto their act, but not so with this guy, who came on with eyes bloodshot and a chip on his shoulder.  Throughout the show I was just thinking please God, don't let him come over here.  And he didn't!  Hooray.

I would not come back.

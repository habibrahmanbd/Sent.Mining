HAD to come here today because my son wanted falafel balls for dinner(I went to Costco, Walmart, nobody carries them.) I hate the customer service here but love the products. Today at checkout, I didn't get a hello but I got a thankyou and a have a nice day. Maybe things are starting to look up here. It needs to because there is never anybody in this store. They are probably busy on Saturdays. Today, they had 3 checkouts open and there was not a queue at any.

I'm blasting this place because the entire restaurant staff was in a blatantly terrible mood, noticed by my table and other patrons of the restaurant.  It's a shame, too because the food actually was pretty good and the restaurant did have a trendy feel to the place, which would set it apart for the local scene in Murrysville.

Maybe lunch isn't the right time to come, but it really turned me off...and I'm new to the area and would love to get some "regulars" in the rotation.  

Not sure if this place is going to get a second chance...and if it does, it won't be for a while.

We used to love this location and always went! We visited tonight and it was pretty messy. Some of the machines were broken, they didn't have any chocolate or peanut butter yogurt, only the ice cream chocolate. The area was overall messy looking and they don't always have the best flavors in stock. Used to love going here and hopefully it gets better!

Cien Agaves, you have potential, but you let me down.

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food. 

Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.

We would have ended up spending a lot more $ here on food and drinks but decided to go other places in old town to get good service.

Management...please take the helpful hints, because I know you can be a good restaurant.

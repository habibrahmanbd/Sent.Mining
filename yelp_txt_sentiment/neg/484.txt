This location really forces you to go through the drive through because parking is not great.  The line seemed to move quickly, but I would make sure to double check your order before you drive away.  Not only did I get the wrong burger, the fries were soggy and I only got one ketchup when I asked for a few.  

Feel bad about leaving a bad review but I had no choice in this case

This is my first time posting to Yelp despite using it on my constant travels, but this experience warranted it. Whatever you do, do NOT get the brisket here. If you've ever had brisket anywhere else you'll be sorely disappointed. If Guy himself ever walked in and tried the brisket they're serving, he'd rip his name off the sign and burn the building to the ground. Everything else I saw looked delicious, just avoid the brisket. Save your $34!!!

The rent is far too high and is raised every year. The apartments are tiny and very outdated. The women who work in the leasing office are very rude, they act like you've ruined their day if you come to pick up a package. We've called multiple times to have things repaired; they either never show up, don't know how to fix what's wrong, or blame the issue on the tenant. They have ridiculous lease requirements but never enforce any of the community rules (parking, noise, drug use, etc). I would never live here again, and would never recommend it to anyone I know. Don't waste your time looking here.

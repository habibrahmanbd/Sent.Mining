This Motel 6 location is just terrible. My husband and I, plus our two dogs, had just completed a 4 1/2 day move from San Diego, and this was to be our final hotel stay before we moved into the house. We booked this motel about a month in advance, and I had no qualms about it, because I've stayed in MANY Motel 6's and never had a bad experience-until now.

We knew as soon as we pulled up that this motel was not going to be great, but we were tired and just wanted to get out of the car. There were kids all over the place running and screaming without supervision, and more than one sketchy-looking trucker hanging around being creepy. I went inside and got our room key. The front desk at this location looks like its a family living room behind the front desk, and although the gentleman who checked me in was pleasant enough, I just had a bad feeling.

We got to our room, opened the door, and were just shocked. We had asked for a nonsmoking room, and even though it had a nonsmoking sign on it, it absolutely reeked of cigarettes. The beds were stained, sagging, and looked like they might be crawling with something. Besides the cigarette smell, there was some sort of other odor in the room; I can't put my finger on it. Musty, maybe. It was just bad, and as I said, I am not picky with motels at all. We decided that we just could not stay here.

Luckily there was a La Quinta across the streets that accepted dogs, so my husband went back inside to get a refund. He said there was no issue getting the refund, and it seemed like the man had done it frequently. The La Quinta was much better.

Do yourself a favor, and stay away from this Motel 6!

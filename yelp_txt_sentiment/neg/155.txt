There is absolutely no point in coming here if you come late or do not have a daybed.  You won't have anywhere to put your stuff which is a nuisance.  There is bag check but the lines are long.  Plus, sometimes you don't want to stand the entire time in the pool after standing in the long lines in the sun.  I saw a girl get hooked up to an IV and taken out on a wheelchair.  Stay classy, Vegas.

Also.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.  If you do decide to go here, you can go in with full-fledged self-confidence because people will flaunt their stretch marks, cellulite, and other goodies.

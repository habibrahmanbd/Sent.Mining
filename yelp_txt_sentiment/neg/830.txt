I can remember being in Gus's when I was too young to go to the restroom by myself.  It was a regular in my life as we lived on Commonwealth, so we'd eat at Gus's all the time and I'd get 13, 6 and 11 as those numbers meant beef tips, mashed potatoes and AMAZING fried squash.  

I'm now 38 and still live very close by, but Gus's is SO not the same place that it once was.  The building is filthy, outside and inside.  The servers are sub-par and the food simply isn't worth eating...  I ride by twice a day and miss my beloved 13, 6 & 11.

HEY! - OWNER OF GUS'S!!!  PLEASE CALL GORDON RAMSEY TO COME GET GUS'S BACK ON IT'S FEET!!!  even if you don't give a damn about it anymore- we local's out here do still care and want to give you our money!  Please ask for the help you so clearly need.

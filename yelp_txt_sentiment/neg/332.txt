I will never recommend this place to anyone. I went in for a miscarriage and had to tell EVERYONE I came in contact with over the course of two appointments that I lost the baby after receiving things like "are you excited for the new baby?", "oh good, the test I took were negative" & "you're about this far along so this is what you will see in the ultrasound" (these were not the only comments and it is obvious no one looks at the files for their patients.) When I went to pay for my second appointment the girl tried to get me on the plan for paying for the birth. I had to decline her 4 times. I still received 2 letters in the mail for the plan of birth including pay by dates. Then the last straw was they charged me close to $3000 for the damn plan and other things that I had already paid out of pocket for. Again, I had a miscarriage. My baby died and I am still receiving and expected to pay for something I WILL NOT HAVE. Every letter from them is a reminder of what my family lost and as much progress as we have made in healing this doctors office sets us back. There is no compassion here. If I could give less than one star I would.

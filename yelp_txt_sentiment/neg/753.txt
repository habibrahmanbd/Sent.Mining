Spoon is an experience one must try. The atmosphere is lovely. I have to be honest though ...during restaurant week the service was rather horrible. I understand they have a lot on their plate serving a crowd of people. The food was nothing higher than average. I got the hanger steak special .. It came out cold and was very tough. The 1st course was a pot roast served on noddles and it was cold as well. The cheese board, wine, and bread were great! In addition the spoon bar for dessert was just okay. The topping chocolate part just tasted like a fudge Popsicle. Overall none of the dishes really stood out. I was surprised because most places for restaurant week go all out .

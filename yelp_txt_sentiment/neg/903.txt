Meh...

Just don't get the love for this place. Have been twice and will never go back for 3 reasons:

1) poor selection of beer for a place that calls itself an ale house
2) music is so loud it's almost impossible to carry on a conversation if you sit inside
3) uninspired food. Very uninspired.
4) wait staff acts like they don't give a crap. About you being there. About them being there. Surreal.

Ok that was 4 reasons. They do have a great patio but that's it. I'm not willing to sit thru boring food, a lousy beer selection, an surly waiters to come here. Too many other good locally owned places in central Phoenix to waste your time and money here.

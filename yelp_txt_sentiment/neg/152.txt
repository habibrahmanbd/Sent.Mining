If you are looking for entertainment from the wait staff, save your time and money because you will not get it at this location.  Not only did we not have an interactive waitress, we did not see any around us.  We love Dick's Last Resort, however, going to this location was a total let down for our family.  This experience for us was nothing more than a very expensive dinner with no entertainment.  Very disappointing...

So I called the company for a price quote to remove a kitchen sink and install a new kitchen sink and to use the existing faucet. The garbage disposal needed to be taken off and then placed back on. There was no major retrofitting of the drain coming out from the wall. A standard kitchen sink installation. My jaw dropped to the floor! $3500. So I wasn't sure I heard him correctly. I thought perhaps he may have misunderstood me or I him . I reviewed what I wanted and he reaffirmed the price. BLA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Be very afraid!

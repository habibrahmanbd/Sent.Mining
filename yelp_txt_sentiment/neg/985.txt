I've debated leaving this review for a good while. I've been here many times and I keep giving it another chance because I love the idea of the place but unfortunately the service is still awful. If you decide to eat here you need to plan on staying 2-3 hours due to extremely slow service (even if you make a reservation on their special nights). It's always taken at least 20-30 minutes after being seated just to get waters, let alone orders taken. Some of the food is amazing, some is mediocre. Usually it comes out room temperature which is another bummer. The place is small, 11-12 tables maybe, usually with 2-4 people at a table. Last time we were there, we saw 3 different people waiting the tables but were also checking people out. Perhaps it would be easier for them if they had someone run the register and to-go area and other people work the tables. It really is too small to have these sorts of issues. Another problem is that we usually each order something from the first, seconds, and thirds on the menu but they ALL come out at the same time. Don't expect appetizers here. We also ordered iced coffees which were dropped off quickly without a word, and creamers were not offered until the next refill. And the cherry on top, is my poor 6 year old child almost always gets served his food last- which is just pancakes and fruit (the only thing on the "kids menu"). Why it takes over an hour for that, I just don't understand. If you still want to eat here, get food off the to-go menu- unless you like spending a good portion of your day in very hot, non- air conditioned restaurants.

Had gotten a mailer that said lunch $9.99 start. Why not try. Service was slow. Drink refills slower. Bread with cheese was yummy! Not impressed to much with food. I had got a stuff baked potatoe with roasted veggies and chicken. I had to find the chicken. There was lots of veggies. I rather had more chicken or a balance. 
The other dish tri-tip with mashed potatoes and gravy. Same roasted veggies. The mashed potatoes was under meat once you moved it was. There was barley any. 2 drinks and 2 meals 32$. Not a good price for lunch, and slow service.

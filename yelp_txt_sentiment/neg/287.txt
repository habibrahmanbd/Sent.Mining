WOW!  That's all I have to say.  Not sure what happened since the last time I was here, but it was like going to a completely different restaurant.  Horrible, rude service from BOTH of the waitresses, not just from the one that all the other people here have mentioned--tall, nasty, and always has a look on her face like someone just took a crap in her cereal.  And I sort of got the impression that because I am gaijin (ie: not Japanese) I may have pissed them off even more.  Food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  Needless to say--no tip.  I would have RELISHED the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--I guarantee she wouldn't have found that to be a pleasant experience.  You all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!!

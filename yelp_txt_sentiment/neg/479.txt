Most unprofessional business I've ever dealt with. We had them scheduled to move us out of our apartment for over a week, and they called less than 24 hours before the move to cancel on us. They claimed their truck was in the shop, but I have a very hard time believing that they only have one truck available to move customers. It really put us in a bind and we are now trying to find movers at the last minute, which is extremely difficult.

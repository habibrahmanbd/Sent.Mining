I'm not sure what I was expecting from Artisano but I didn't really get much. We both ordered the lunch combo and a coffee, which cost $29. The half sandwich was about a half cup of chicken salad and all bread! They called this a gourmet sandwich - what a joke. The Kale Super salad was small soggy and tasteless. My salad was just ok. 
I would never go back.

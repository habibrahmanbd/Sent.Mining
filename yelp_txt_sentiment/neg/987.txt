Went to see what all the hype was about. Only a few flavors available. Got a two scoop of chocolate and "get figgy with it". Cost close to $9.00 for two scoops no toppings. I'm all about supporting local businesses but feel this place is a little over priced for what you get. Quality was okay as was customer service.

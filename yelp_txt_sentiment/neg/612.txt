don't use this place - they charge way too much and do a terrible job.
I had a pair of jeans hemmed and wanted the original hem - they charged
$25 and rolled up the hem and it looked awful!!!   And the employees are
rude too!  I then had to go somewhere else to have them fixed right for another $20.

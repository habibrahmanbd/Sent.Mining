Tried this new Denny's for breakfast this morning,we were seated for a few minutes, when a waiter finally came over and took our order we asked for coffee and sat there for fifteen minutes waiting no coffee was ever brought so we got up and left! Ridiculous we then went to Cocos where as soon as we were seated hot coffee was brought.

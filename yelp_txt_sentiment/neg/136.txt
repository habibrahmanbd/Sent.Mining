They don't deserve any stars! 
I am from out of state and my check engine light comes on and I have to get back on the road today. No, I don't have an appt. it's not like I know I need to get an oil change. Mazda: Sorry I can try to work you in but it's not fair to the other customers. How about appeasing the customer that is about to get on the road just to find out what's wrong and if I can safely drive home?  I didn't know my check engine light was going to come on. I understand about appt's but gee you can't just see what the issue may be and if I can drive it.

Horrible experience I went in to get a full set french tips the guy who did them was very rude never said a word only yanked at my hand he cut my real nails after I told him not to. I complained about bubbles and dust inside the acrylic they acted like they couldn't see it. Two days later my nails are lifting and more bubbles appeared. I will never go here again and hope others don't waste their time or money at this place.

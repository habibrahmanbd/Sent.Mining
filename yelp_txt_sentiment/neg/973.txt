I'd rather have store bought pizza from a box than eat this crap. My wife and I like to try different pizza shops so we tried Papa Nick's. Over priced and really bland, absolutely no taste. OMG , put some seasoning in your sauce. The crust tastes like card board. Save your money and go anywhere else.

I was pretty underwhelmed given the sparking reviews. Then again, this is based off of a single visit, so maybe some baristas here actually give a damn about what they serve. The latte I got was way too hot, and made with re-steamed soy milk that had been sitting out in a steaming pitcher--a definite no-no at any decent cafe. It may be difficult to get soy milk to the proper consistency, but there wasn't even an attempt here. The result was a mediocre beverage on par with something I could've gotten at any coffee chain (e.g. Espresso Royale, Starbucks, etc). Though it's on the other side of town, I would have gladly gone to Bradbury's on my trip through for a quality latte had I known EVP's would be barely drinkable.

Ugh. I dread having to attend events here. The miles and miles of useless parking 99% of the time, the f*ing SEVEN DOLLAR parking fee on top of the ticket price, are you kidding me?!? Get out of here with that mess. This is Madison, not NYC, and you still have to walk a mile from your vehicle to enter the cavernous, soullness metal frame and concrete warehouse that sucks all the joy out of whatever event you came there to see. Being that it's basically set in a marsh among wildlife and water, you'd think they could care a bit more about environmental impact. I hate this place. Sorry.

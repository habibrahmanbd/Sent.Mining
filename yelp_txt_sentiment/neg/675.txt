Comments
- BBQ Pork is a definitely "must-try" here, its pretty darn amazing. 
- Service is mediocre | Manager was good, but the rest was just un-enthusiastic, un-willing to work/move. 
- Food came out in batches, making a full a 9 course dinner service kind of odd | took them roughly 45 minutes to service all 9 dishes.

Sadly this place has been sold.  The gas prices have sky rocketed, some of the long term staff is gone, lottery is gone, they have run out of popular cigarettes, I tried to get gas a few days ago and the vendors / delivery trucks that used to park on the side street or off to the side were parked at the pumps...I am going to give it a little time and see if it gets better.  I have been going to this store for 15+ years, but if it doesn't shape up, I will find another....

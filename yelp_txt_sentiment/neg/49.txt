Absolute waste of money. My husband and I felt no different after using the oxygen bar, massages and drinking the $5 peppermint drink. The employee was very sweet, but don't waste your money. This place would get 1 star if the customer service sucked. And they tell you it's $22 for the oxygen, but they also charge $5 for the thing that goes in your nose.

Wow, so delicious.  I don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast!

We used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola, which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor.  Then our savory crepes came out quickly, the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda, with local ham).  Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well.  I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs.

As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.

Overall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!

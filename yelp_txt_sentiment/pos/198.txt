Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much, made good suggestions and generally let us be silly, nearby table neighbors were great, food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce. 

The salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty, not gourmet, just perfectly normal, fresh tasting tomato, basil and olive oil yumminess.

We also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!

Overall, even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting), with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!

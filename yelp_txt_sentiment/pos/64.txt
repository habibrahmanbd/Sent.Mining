I used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.

This place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.

Parking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long, so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait, first-timers).

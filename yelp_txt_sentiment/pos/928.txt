Jessica to the rescue!  I came here after another salon destroyed my hair.  It had been processed 2 times in one week, the 2nd time was an attempt to fix the 1st try, and it looked horrible!  I refused to go back to the other salon and searched for someone well reviewed with good knowledge about color.  I found Jessica and was not disappointed.  

I showed her photos of what I wanted originally, told her at this point I just wanted to be comfortable walking out of the house.  Part of my hair was almost blonde, part was almost black, so to give me highlights and even color throughout was going to be hard.  I thought I would need blonde highlights throughout, but she said she could get it closer to the look in the photos.  

We went over colors, she gave suggestions and input based on my skin tone. - From that moment on, I felt comfortable.  She was really taking her time. - Asking lots of questions, discussing what would look best and what would be less harsh on my hair.
She foiled me up, gave me a conditioning treatment, added a little more color, then cut, dried and styled.  She was very friendly and attentive through the whole process.  
I'm so happy, and VERY impressed.  I truly love the color and cut!!  

Check out the photo I posted here to get a better idea of how hard of a job it was, and the incredible work she did.  Jessica has a lot of skill!  
My hair is not only better than I expected, it is better than I though was possible!  I have finally found my hair stylist in Las Vegas!

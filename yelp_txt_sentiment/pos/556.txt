Travel weary and need of food - as I walked out my hotel heard some excellent acoustic music - enjoying some music ,  turns out it was $5 burger night - bonus -  California burger was juicy and the gauc and grilled onion perfect - i also tried the tortilla soup which i enjoyed. I also enjoyed the skinny crunchy fries and the chilled and crisp pickle The service was fast and friendly.  When i back to PHX and near the convention center I'll come again

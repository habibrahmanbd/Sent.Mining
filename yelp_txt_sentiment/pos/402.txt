I like to come here every 3-6 months. I'm not huge on injera, so every quarter to half a year is enough to get my fix. 
I have loved this place every single time I went, except the last. 

The (beautiful) waitress is really helpful in helping you choose a dish and (again other than my last visit) they are always delicious. Unfortunately the last time I went the dish she recommended tasted like old Chinese food (which is very strange) but I've been probably 10 other times and each time it has been delicious, so I'm going to just assume it was a one-off bad day and give it another try, because honestly the food is generally really good and filling. 

Prices are decent, they have Groupons available for this place a lot, so if you are nervous about going, wait for a Groupon to be available and that should cover half the meal for 2-3 people. 

The place is usually pretty packed but on a week night you can usually get a seat without having to wait.

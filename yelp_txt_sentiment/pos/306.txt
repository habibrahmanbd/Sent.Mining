I was in Mesa for the morning and found this gem. I was greeted with a big smile and friendly service. The almond latte was really good, like REALLY good! If I lived in Mesa, I'd be a regular for the friendliness, good coffee, and really nice environment. It was busy, but nice and quiet - a feature that seems a bit rare in my experience. If I need coffee in Mesa again, this will be my go to place.

Freaking love this place!! Kyle helped us and gave us samples of whatever we wanted to try. I ended up buying 3 bottles, Local Hottie, The Kitchen Sink, and Sweet Greens and also got a Green Milk shake. We also checked in on Facebook and got a free shot which was really nice, but the shot was super intense! It opened up my sinuses and cleared me right up. I can't remember the name but it had ginger, lemon, and cayenne pepper in it. It burned real good on the way down. Try it!

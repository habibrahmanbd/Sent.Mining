WHOA!

Red Carpet handles business.  No WAIT No LINES No HASSLE,  seriously though.  Why worry about lines in Vegas when you can pregame in the room and immediately step into the club?!?!  

I'd give them a million stars.

Walked into XS -no problem-       9 dudes
Walked into EBC- no problem-    9 dudes
Crazy huge 30 passenger limo- GMC Kodiak or something-   Ridiculous

Couldn't have made my bachelor party better.  I will be using them again and again for as long as I live when I come to Vegas.  All their staff is great with email or phone correspondence, thank you Annie!!

You cannot go wrong with them.  Shell out the extra dough and book your Vegas clubbing experience, you wont be disappointed.

This was my first time here. I tried the salmon enchiladas with brown rice and Cajun beans.

Salmon is a tricky fish as I have mentioned in previous reviews. I was happy to taste well cooked and tender salmon. The red enchilada sauce was spicy, but not unbearable. 

The Cajun beans were also spicy but tender. They were made with white beans. These beans had the right kind of tenderness to indicate they were not canned beans.

The brown rice was regular wheat rice. This is a great place for some Baja fish.

Got another cut and had my first ever straight razor face shave from Thom "Slick Boy".  Book an appointment with this master barber who has mad skills and takes his time making it right.  He makes you feel comfortable with his laid back vibe and easy conversation.  He doesn't disappoint.  You walk out looking and feeling awesome.

They specialize in Southern California-style food like burritos, salsas and fish tacos. The decor and ambiance is great. The tables and bar stools, exposed-brick wall, modern light fixtures etc. make for a classy and comfortable dining experience. I saw a few craft beers and a respectable bourbon list. However, we did an early Saturday morning breakfast, which was fantastic. The banana pancakes were unreal.

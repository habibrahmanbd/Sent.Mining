87 West is awesome!  The decor and fireplace create a hip and cozy atmosphere.  I have been here twice now and everything has been delicious!  My favorite dishes:

the grilled four cheese - so many yummy cheeses and melted perfectly
the chorizo flatbread - super delish, perfect combination of toppings
the baked brie - love the combination of brie and sweet compote 
the carbonara - really good carbonara sauce, my only wish is that it had pancetta instead of chicken an bacon

The wine list and wait staff also added to the awesomeness.  Our waitress was super friendly, nice and good at her job. I will definitely be back soon!

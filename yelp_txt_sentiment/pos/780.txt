Amazing ice cream parlour!!!! We were staying at an air bnb nearby, and opted to treat myself to a cone before I head home. Man, was the ice cream CREAMY. Though, the cone is not the best quality, the ice cream itself trumphs most places I've had. Get it in a cup if it satisfy you. Bottom line: TRY IT, you won't be disappointed. Wish I discovered it earlier. would've had a cone everyday!!!!

Better than hot & juicy and boiling crab.. They would have gotten 5 starts from me, but they forgot my crab legs! The main reason I wanted to come here.. It was disappointing, but the flavors are really good and the seafood was very fresh.. I love that they use real butter in the sauce and not margarine like all the other crawfish spots!! So this will be my new seafood spot..

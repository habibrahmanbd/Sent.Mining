I come here weekly to volunteer for the Backpack program.  If you're not aware of this program, Three Square provides "backpacks" of food for hungry kids that are enrolled in the school lunch program in order to give them food for the weekends.  It is a really great program and they serve approximately 7000 kids in multiple schools and counties in Nevada.

While I admit the backpacks are mostly full of stuff I'd never eat or give my kids (chocolate milk, frosted flakes, vienna sausage, etc), I still think it is a worthwhile program and I'm proud to be one of the people that helps stuff the packs with food and gets them out to hungry kids.

I love Pizza, but I try to stay away for dietary reasons. I went here last week with my daughter and mom, and was pleasantly surprised. Thin crust New York style pizza at a good price. The menu is kind of simple, but that's the way these places are nowadays. Friendly staff and clean simple surroundings.

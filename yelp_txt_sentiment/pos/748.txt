I've shopped at a half-dozen or so Neighborhood Markets. This is Walmart's Supermarket concept. That means that it's about groceries and dairy and frozen and meats, plus a section for personal care. The store doesn't have a Tire & Lube or a Vision and not much for electronics and zero for housewares and clothing. Just food.

And as Neighborhood Markets go, this one was pretty good. The shelves were stocked, the store was tidy on a Sunday morning and the associates who I encountered knew the "Ten Foot Rule."

It was a good shop.

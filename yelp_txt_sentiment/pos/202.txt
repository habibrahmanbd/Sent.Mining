My family and I visited and decided to take some pictures with the green screen so they can edit in the Avengers in them afterwards. Since this was our first time visiting this place, the staff was very patient and helped guide us. When we went to go check out which ones to print, Agent Collins was a great help. We loved his easy going personality and he has great customer service! 10/10 would visit again. The pics came out very nice too! Thank you, Agent Collins. Continue to show your awesome personality and great customer service! Very much appreciated.

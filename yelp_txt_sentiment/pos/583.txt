The atmosphere may be what you'd expect of a bar in the middle of a suburban development, but the food and drink are pretty good. 

Our friends love their beer, we gushed over their root beer. The malted berry drink was perfect for lightweights. 

The Wisco Porker pizza was tasty and full of meat - just as you would want and expect. 

Nice bonus - Free shots after touchdowns during Badger games. Woop!

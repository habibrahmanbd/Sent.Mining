I read the reviews and I am sorry to hear those people had a bad experience.  I work for the owner of an apartment complex in Scottsdale and Rainforest has done an outstanding job on all of our issues.  They are timely, they are much less expensive than our previous vendor, and they have fixed every problem they have been called out for.  I highly recommend them.

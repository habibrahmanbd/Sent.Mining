So this is where all the fabrics I have been looking for are kept! I stumbled on Carol's Fabric Shop when I was working in the area and didn't have a lot to spend. You can bet, though, that I am headed here on my own time. I need more of this. Even though I live 250 miles away, I've told others about it who are going to be in the area and check it out this weekend. I love this place and can't wait until I can come back and really go shopping.

Atmosphere is nice, decor is cute and staff is really nice. The most important thing is that the food is BOMB. I got a buche taco, al pastor taco, and Mexican corn on the cob. The al pastor taco was the best out of all of them, with lots of juicy meat despite it looking weird and dry on the meat spinner (is that what it's called?). Buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad. The corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit. The mole fries are AMAZING. Ten out of ten will come back for them.

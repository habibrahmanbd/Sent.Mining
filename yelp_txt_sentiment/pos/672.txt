We were looking for Lancasters and ended up here.. which was good bc the food was pretty good! 

I had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious. The sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that I expect when I'm getting homemade chips. 

Other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)

Note: They had the BEST Sweet tea I've had in a few years. Really super delish.
I'd definetely go back here.

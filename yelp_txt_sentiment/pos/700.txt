OK - we were so sad and bummed when Momma Mias didn't come back. It was our go-to pizza place and it killed us! The we found out about this and were sooooo excited. Now normally, I think you would want places to be different or unique or doing their own thing, but I am so happy that these guys kept to the simple amazing pizza they had before! It was so good and so nice to have something close and back that we love! The wings were great too! Delivery was wicked fast! 

Guess we will be back to Sunday night pizza again :)

Don't get me wrong the 1 stars reviews are correct and accurate,  but knowing that in advance and the dirt cheap price made it worth while.  The sheets were clean and and the plumbing works.  As a place to crash for cheap I can recommended it.  If you are bothered by dirty floors and a place that is in almost complete disrepair, then spend much more to stay somewhere else. I stayed here for two nights and was happy.

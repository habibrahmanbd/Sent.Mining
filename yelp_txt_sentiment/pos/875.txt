I just moved here 2 months ago from California. I was having such a hard time finding a nail salon I was happy with.  I am the pickiest when it comes to my nails. This place was amazing! I love my nails by Angie! She was so detailed. She definitely takes pride in her work.  Thank you! Everyone there is so nice and caring! So glad to finally find a manicurist!

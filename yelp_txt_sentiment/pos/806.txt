Took my Mom here for a game night, and we had a blast! 

All games are free and pinball is 50 cents. I consider this to be very reasonable. They have change machines for cash, but we didn't have cash. No ATM...yet. We had to go get cash to play. I don't think this will be an issue anymore once the ATM is available. We went early on a Thursday night and we practically had the place to ourselves. Not the biggest game selection I've seen, but still great. Also have foosball. 

Beer selection is decent, even though a few taps were out when we were there. A lot of local offerings. I LOVE the bar is made out of old cassette tapes! We tried the nacho pretzel, and it was a bit of a let down. Needed more salt, more flavor. I'm sure this will all get better as things go.

Overall, I am so pumped to have this place in South End! It is a great break from the usual and a great place to hang out any day of the week. We will be back! The only thing that made me do 4 instead of 5 stars was the food.

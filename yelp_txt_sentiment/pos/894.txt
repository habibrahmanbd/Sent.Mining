Finally, a night spot that doesn't feel like old-Calgary, or drunk and slutty Calgary. I've hit up Commonwealth a couple of times and I'm diggin' the digs. Larger bar upstairs, more clubby atmosphere downstairs or lounge in the front, you've got your pick.

This isn't a spot to come for dinner, no siree. But for nibblets and some yummy bourbon cocktails (me and bourbon are new found friends since last August), colour me sold, Commonwealth is a place I hope to find myself more often.

You'll want to try the apple something cocktail. I can't remember the full name, but it's got ginger in there somewhere and it's AWESOME. The shrimp loaf thing is also quite tasty, as are the spring roll taquito bits and the sliders.

Decor, well, I think you should go have a look for yourself... keep an eye out for the stuffed crows.

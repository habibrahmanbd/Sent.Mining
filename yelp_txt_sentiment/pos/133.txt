Ikea....an experience!

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Do yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!

I don't understand the negative reviews for this place, I really like the pho and in terms of customer service I have never had an issue. The best thing about this place is the actual noodles they use. It has a great chewy texture. The broth has good flavour and it is good value. Also the fresh shrimp roll had tons of filling including different herbs. It is on my regular rotation of pho places.

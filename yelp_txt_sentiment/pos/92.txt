A toned down version of the king street location, GotStyle is a great store primarily for the service you receive.

It's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached. But if you shop at places like Holt Renfrew or even the Bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion.  The reason - the sales agents are just better. They have pretty good sales twice a year, which is when I tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times. I appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range.  

Overall, I wouldn't get my formal wear from here. That's just me personally. I'd rather go to the U.S. and pay half the price for the same quality. But if you can't do that, they have an excellent selection and great tailors. You can find cheaper tailors in Toronto, but at least at GotStyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer. You can trust the store. 

They have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too. 
This is definitely a go to place if you're anything like me and don't know how to buy jeans. My last visit at the store, Jannette spent a great deal of time educating my friend and I on how to dress. We left the store uncharacteristically self aware of ourselves, but really, we learnt a great deal in the process.

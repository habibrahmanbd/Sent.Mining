This is my first time using UHAUL, the manager at the desk was the best! She really knew how to take care of all of her customers, when I pulled up, she was outside loading a trailer onto a hitch, and she wasn't driving, she had gloves on muscling that trailer around, good for her! When she came in, she was so helpful! She upgraded my truck and threw in some extra's including an extra day. I was dreading going there, but she made it all better. One of the employee's came in & she asked how he wash, he replied that he wasn't doing well. She was genuinely concerned. She really knows how to run a store. 

PS... if you need moving supplies they have the best prices! I went to lowe's and spent way more! Enjoy!

I've been to Sakana twice for lunch and both times have been happy with the sushi and service. Instead of creating longer rolls with more pieces of sushi they create shorter, fatter rolls. Makes for a bigger piece of sushi which I'm ok with. 

I'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale. 

If you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant I'd recommend you try Sakana out.

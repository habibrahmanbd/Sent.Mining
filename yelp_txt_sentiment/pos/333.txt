I've had their "Cleveland's" breakfast many times and it is perfect every time. The best eggs and sausage breakfast in town. I don't know how they do it, but their scrambled eggs are the best I've ever had. I've tried to duplicate it at home without success. I get the same thing every time I go. Scrambled eggs with sausage, potatoes and toast with a side of Guinness. Yum!

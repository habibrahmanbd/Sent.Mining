Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.

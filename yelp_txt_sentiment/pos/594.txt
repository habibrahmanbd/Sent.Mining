Yeah I hear people always raggin' about the post office, but you know what gang? The postal service has the best deal anywhere in the world! You can ship stuff all over the world, it is cheaper to use the the US Postal Servie, then any of those private shipping companies - FedEx, UPS, DHL.........etc.

Last month while I was in Las Vegas, I did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved Hawaii Warriors play football against UNLV.

While I was in Las Vegas, I decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage, as I was basically away for just 2.5 days.

As a professional traveler, I like to travel light, and if I take something with me on a trip..........I'll be sure to use it! 
Don't you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? I've learned over the years from all my travels for work to "travel efficiently", and I hate carrying extra stuff.........because all you're doing is lugging excessive weight!

How does the Post Office come into play? 

Well, on my trip I decided to got to Trader Joe's (It's a Hawaii thing.........we don't have TJ in Hawaii).

But that's not it gang..........sure, I could have carried some of the stuff I bought home (which I did), but due to security, & TSA rules.........if you buy anything "liquid" or "paste" it cannot be over 3 oz. when you do any kind of carry on.

Catch my drift???

So after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff), I realized I could not carry that onto the plane with me, so the next best thing to do.............yes gang! Go to the US Post Office, get one of them free - "Flat Rate" Boxes, load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it's fragile), then tape it up.........and ship it out to yourself! In this case.........back to da 808!

Whaaaalaaaah! Not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage, which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars), but you don't have to carry it home either! What a smart Hawaiian I am 'eh!!!!! Lol!

So if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel..............may I suggest this method to work around the dilemma you're in.

Just an FYI..........

Large Flat Rate Box cost only $17.90 to ship. If it fits........you can ship! 

Medium Flat Rate Box cost only $12.65 to ship. And again..........if it fits........you can ship!

This Post Office also has a automated kiosk, which is nice, because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed, or say you come here on a Sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed). 
In my case...........I shipped my box out on Sunday, and used the kiosk! No problemo gang! Easy bruddah! Winning!!!!

What a great service that the US Postal Service provides! MAHALO! :D

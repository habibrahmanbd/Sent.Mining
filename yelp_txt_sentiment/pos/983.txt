I was quite surprised by my visit to Adega.
We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far!
After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that
Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers.
For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me.
Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here
Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that
Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service

Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive. 

To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.

Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure.
This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner!

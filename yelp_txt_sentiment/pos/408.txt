When looking up hotels to stay in, I was skeptical about this and many other hotels, as one usually is in a city the've never visited. However, I was extremely pleased with my stay at Platinum.

Location: Located next to an AM/PM gas station. This was great because I could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places. The hotel is very visible but still in the cut. About a half mile or so from the Venetian.

Customer Service: When I walked in, I was greeted with warmth. It was about 1 am, so not many people were in the lobby. Which was actually the case throughout my entire trip. I chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends. He was just that nice. And he made me feel so welcome!

Room: Can I tell you that this room was EVERYTHING in LIFE?! Ok. There I told you. I was in room 402 I believe. This room was in fact a suite. I felt like it was an apartment and I had a lease. Freaking HUGE! It had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge, stove / oven, microwave, dishwasher and bar), living room, balcony, bedroom with 2 queen beds, a safe, closet and tv and bathroom with closet, garden tub, separate bathroom and double sink vanity. The bathroom was the size of most rooms. Completely clean!!!!

I stayed in it by myself. What a wondrous time!!!!!!! I had everything I needed and then some. And the view! Perfect view of the strip. It's the perfect way to be a part of Vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino. At half the price. Or less, depending on when you go. My first night in Vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room.

Tip: Even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa, at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub. So relaxing!

I will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this March! Can't wait!

Im sure I left something out but you get the gist right? If not....stay here!! You won't regret it!

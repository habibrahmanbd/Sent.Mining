Paul reached out to, and all issues were addressed !! Thanks, Paul !

This review is for the Henderson location. I could have sworn I submitted a review when it happened, but it somehow disappeared. Weird. Anyways, I heard the Vegas location is much better. /shrug

I had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.

The other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.

Now somebody rear ended me, and guess what, the insurance company wants to send me there. There's not a snowball's chance in hell I ever have them touch any of my cars again.

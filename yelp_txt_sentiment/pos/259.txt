Never had Belizean food or have heard of them and they're right in front of my building for 7 months. Finally made my way over there and it's so dang good! Chicken fell off the bone. I ordered tamales since it's the special right now and it's huge for $5.50! Why did I wait so long! I was skeptical at first didn't know what to expect. Owners are super nice.

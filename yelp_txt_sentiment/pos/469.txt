Amy is amazing and an outstanding example of going above and beyond. I cannot thank her enough for taking the time out of her time off on a Saturday to ensure we were taken care of.

My father in law passed away late Friday, June 2nd. We went to the funeral home at 12 noon Saturday June 3rd to make arrangements for his visitation, funeral and graveside service. We left after 2pm and went to another florist in the area that was a friend of the family. No offense to that florist, her selections were slim pickings and she didn't seem too accommodating since she was low on fresh cut flowers because of "prom weekend". My wife was so upset because she wanted the perfect flower arrangement for her "daddy".

We began calling to realize that florist shut down and close shop early on Saturdays. I also know that sometimes a shop owner will still be around working, even though the shop is closed. I called Talley's and left a message... it was a shot in the dark. My wife didn't want to wait until Monday to figure this out when the visitation was scheduled for that evening. 

After about 20 minutes of giving up, my phone rang... it was Amy! She took the time to talk with us outside of business hours. She was sympathetic and compassionate towards us and our circumstances. We trusted her expertise and experience to provide us with an beautiful flower/plant combination.

We arrived to the funeral home Monday evening and looked for the flower/plant arrangement. WOW! It was so beautiful! My wife started crying. It was exactly why she wanted.

Amy went above and beyond for us. Her expert knowledge combined with taking the time to listen to us to understand our wishes produced an amazing arrangement. She is an example of what your floral experience should be. We would recommend Amy and Talleys Florist with full knowledge of how she interacts with actual customers.

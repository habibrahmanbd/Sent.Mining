Great food in a homely Mexican setting. The tomato soup was amazingly delicious and their chicken dishes are great. Close to the intersection of College & Yonge, this is one of the few non-fast food Mexican restaurants in the Village area.  If you're searching for a non-commercial dining experience with homemade dishes, this is the place to come.

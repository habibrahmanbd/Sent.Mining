The Four Stars = to  how expensive this place is.  I only saw two dollar signs for this place, but it should be four dollar signs.

I don't remember what I ordered but it all came to $75.00
( 2 ) bacon egg sandwiches 
( 2 ) other breakfast sandwiches
( 2 ) breakfast desserts
( 2 ) juices or water
I'm pretty sure this was all I ordered.

It tasted good because at 2:30am we were all hungry.  I ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here.  I remember that I didn't have to wait very long after placing my order.  I remember that we all scarfed it down in matter of a minute.  I vaguely remember crawling into bed soon after.

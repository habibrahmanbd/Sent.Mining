Been a while since we came here but loved it.  Little bit loud but ok and maybe not as fancy as some of its other locations (Chicago, Miami), but:

- food was same and awesome.  
- loved the Wygu Beef Gyoza, couple rolls we had, salad, drinks, etc.

Great menu right now they have to choose from.  Seems the same in all cities for the moment.

Really great place. Went there on the advice of a friend, and now I'm a bit obsessed with Ron himself. 

Such a character, and I mean that in the best sense of the word. He does great work, and always goes above and beyond. 

Not expensive at all, and your shoes come back looking perfect (actually, more than so). Got two heels replaced, and he even polished them up nicely before giving them back. 

So taken with the experience that I wrote about Cecil's on my blog. (http://looksharpsconnie.blogspot.com/2012/05/cecil-shoe-doctor.html)

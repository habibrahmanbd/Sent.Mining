We were fans of Flat Top but now like this better because you don't have to wait so long for your food.  You have to stand there while they cook it but for some reason this seems faster than sitting at your table.  They have a wider variety of food and meat than Flat Top also and because they have the two sides of the buffet open with the same choices, you don't feel as rushed with people crowding you.

The kids love it.  We like to get the tortillas and they are a little slow bringing those - they give you only 3 at a time and when the whole group is using them, they don't go very far.  

HuHot is really a bargain for kids - I think that it's $5 for all you can eat.  Oh, that's another benefit - you can go up and get more at any time.

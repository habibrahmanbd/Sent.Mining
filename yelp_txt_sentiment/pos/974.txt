Bought a used 2012 Mazda Speed 3 from this dealer today. I traded in my car as well. The dealership overall I am giving 4 stars, I would give Matt, my salesman, 5 stars for him alone. 

I found the vehicle online after several days of searching for the right car to trade mine in for. I called and made an appointment to test drive the vehicle. I arrived early but was greeted and offered refreshment immediately. Really loved the vehicle and started negotiating. Basically told them what I wanted and could do and they met me exactly there without any issue. They also gave me more for my trade in than anyone else had offered. It took a long time to get with the finance manager and that part was the only real detractor from the experience. 

I did notice the typical extra items they could have tried to tack on and it sounds like from other reviews they sometimes try to add that stuff on, but if you give them the bottom line and have confidence knowing what you need in your vehicle, probably won't be a problem.

I highly recommend this dealer.

Wow...no reviews on here yet? I am surprised...I love this gym.  I like a lot of gyms, but I LOVE this gym!

I started training with Bobby at Results Only right before my wedding and within 10 weeks of working out with Bobby I lost about 15 lbs and 1 dress size. My husband had similiar results. My arms never looked better...I was sincerely a beautiful bride...at age 43 I looked better at this wedding than my 1st one! 

When we first started looking at gyms we were struggling with how to fit in everything we were looking for in a gym...times of classes, co-ed so we both could attend, small enough for personalized attention, motivating enough to keep us coming back and fun...we hate working out, so if we were going to avoid going out for drinks and dinner we needed some SERIOUS motivation.

The group training is co-ed, the classes are offered at the perfect times for our schedule, the gym is near our home and the owner, Bobby, is crazy funny and terribly motivating - he keeps us going!

BUT....I really knew that Results Only fit our family and our lifestyle when Bobby introduced his TEEN fitness program to my son! Bobby was an instant hit with my Pre-Teen and now he is eagerly getting in shape and learning about fitness, gaining confidence and having fun at Results Only. We are hooked. I can't imagine where we would find a gym like this and I have tried quite a few gyms in the valley - and have great things to say about many of them - but Bobby has offered us the MOST for our family and delivered the highest level of results. 

Thanks Bobby...from all of us! I can't wait to see what we look like on our wedding anniversary!

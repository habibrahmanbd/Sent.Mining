The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm....

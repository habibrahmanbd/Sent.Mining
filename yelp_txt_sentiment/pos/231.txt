Interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully.
I had Harajuku and Penicillin & they are amazing especially the penicillin. The dash of Islay really takes it to the next level.
All the bartender look very passionate & our main bartender Joseph was amazing.
Def worth stopping by.

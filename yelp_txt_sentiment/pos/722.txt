All last week, I was sampling different wing places for the best wings. And, I chose wing time! I came in last week and got a little combo just for myself. The combo was just what I wanted, six pieces of wings, with two different flavors. Some blue cheese, french fries, Texas toast. Not to mention, a drink! You get a lot. I did get a little side order of carrots, but it wasn't expensive at all.

Today, we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church. They are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church. So, I placed an order for the 30 wings special. I ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when I got there. Everything was there. And, I really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag.

Everybody loved the wings including myself. I will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future, there will be another party, I will definitely get their large wings special deal again! I really love their wings! They are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Plus, they have the best customer service!

After agonizing over where to have our one upscale meal in Montreal, we decided on Chez L'epicier.  We were glad we did.  We did the tasting menu will wine pairings (note that 2 courses do not come paired) and our "journey" included a savory macaroon amuse bouche, gazpacho, gnocci, cod, goose, foix gras, and more.  The tastes were small but hearty, most with a delicious inventive sauce.  The wines were great and ran the gamut of classic French wines, and were well paired.  

The service was perfectly paced, with our server prepping our next course and pouring wine, and another server serving and explaining each dish.

We were able to get a same day reservation on a Monday night.  The space was about 3/4 full, and the meal took 2.5 hours due to the numerous tastings and relaxed pace.  The decor is modern chic, and there is a bar area to do bites/drinks.  

Dress code - you will not feel out of place if you aren't in a jacket - but I'd recommend making this your dress up night.

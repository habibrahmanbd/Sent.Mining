Im giving this place four stars more for sentiment than taste, but their food is decent. The falafel and gyro sandwiches are both on the small side but tasty and made in a flash. They have basic middle eastern groceries as well as a few hot dishes and classic desserts such as baklava and cashew fingers. A great place to get feta, dolmas , tabouli, or hummus. The baba ganouj is excellent.

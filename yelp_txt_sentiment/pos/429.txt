The Venetian is an elegant and distinguished resort and casino. Gorgeous and romantic decor and interior. On the way to your room, you are greeted by candlelit hallways and ceilings to light your way. Even though I didn't try the restaurant, Bouchon, the smells emanating from the kitchen made my mouth water. The casino was expansive and had signs everywhere for easy navigation. Rooms are huge, clean, and well-maintained. The convenience store and bakery/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something. The Venetian is a must-stay if you are ever in Las Vegas and will give you a dining, gambling, and staying experience that you will never forget.

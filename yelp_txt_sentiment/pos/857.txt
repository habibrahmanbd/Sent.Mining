Been to just about every Thai place in Vegas. Archis is definitely one of the best. Best beef noodle soup in town by far. Spent a month in Thailand and although the name kind of has an american feel, the food is authentic! So good! Do your self a favor and eat here. For the price, one of Vegas' gems.

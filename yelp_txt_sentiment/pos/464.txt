Looked this place up before making appointment, April did a great job. I had to wait a while even with an appointment but they apologized and serviced me and my daughter to our satisfaction. Their hot stone massage was great and you get a full foot and calf massage as part of the $20. Great price, good service.

OAN: It was a little dusty in there. They may want to look into remodeling, but not if that is going to increase the prices. ;-)

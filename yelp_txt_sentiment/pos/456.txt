I tried Nichiban for the first time, and I definitely have to agree with the reviews from the other users for this restaurant.  It's a very small place, tucked in a little corner of a small plaza right across Pacific Mall at Steeles/Kennedy, but the food is delicious.  Being a big fan of salmon sashimi, I asked if the sashimi bento and other main courses containing sashimi, can be replaced with all salmon sashimi and yes, it can be done.  I had the salmon sashimi bento box accordingly, and I have nothing but praise for the quality of the sashimi and the taste of the tempura, spicy salmon sushi and even the salad that accompanied the bento.  

They even gave us a huge plate of grilled salmon pieces, all on the house - also quite yummy!  The only aspect that they can improve is to add a little dessert at the end, such as green tea ice cream like many other little sushi restaurants tend to do, however I am very content with this place just as it is.  I will definitely be returning to this place whenever I am in the area.

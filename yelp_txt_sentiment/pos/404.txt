The beauty salon business does well around this area. There's many! 
Dimple's was no great shakes. It was conveniently located to where I was running errands, and brown (so I knew eyebrow threading would be inexpensive and ace).

Eyebrow threading is $4. That's usually what it goes for at these places. No taxes on cash payments! I am not being racist but white places charge more and they don't do a great job. So, always find an Indian or Arab place to go to for threading. 

It hurt. But I came out looking fabulous! #worthit

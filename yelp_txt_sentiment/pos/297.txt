This place serves consistently good Americanized Middle Eastern food. I've had  tuna and lamb plates here, and they've been good. The flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared. Wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time I've been there.  Waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant.

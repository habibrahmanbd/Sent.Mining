I was very skeptical about this spot. 
First it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic, Asian middle eastern, etc. If you want one, go off the strip. 

second A place that proudly serves "Middle eastern" and also "Greek" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion. 

And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good! 
The lamb shawarma was also good.
And branzino fish with labaneh was on point. 

Even though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely. 

So bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot. 
Trust me. I know food.

I've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a Korean friend. The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).

However, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.

In general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu...

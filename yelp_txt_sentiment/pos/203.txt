I have dined here Teppan twice, a la carte twice.
The teppan is very well priced and great food but the chef's are tired. Understandable. There is not the same type of showmanship you can get elsewhere but they are good chefs.
A la carte sushi is great. Pot of soup is huge and delicious.
This is a local place that does well. Service was on point and very attentive last time I came here.

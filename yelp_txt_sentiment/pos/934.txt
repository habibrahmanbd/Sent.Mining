Looking for some incredibly specific and overpriced kitchen gadget? Sur La Table is your best chance of finding it. Whether you need a ceramic ginger grater, a battery-powered pepper mill, or just a new knife, it's probably hiding somewhere in amongst the jumbles of kitchen implements here.

It's lots of fun to browse, but if you're in a hurry, it's best to ask one of the staff to help you find whatever you're looking for--otherwise, you could easily waste a half hour. Luckily, most of the employees seem fairly knowledgable about what's in stock and which fondue pot it's hiding behind. Compared to the Williams Sonoma over at La Place in Beachwood, Sur La Table has a better selection, better prices, and better staff.

Still, I'll generally stop here only if I'm in need of something quickly or just feel like looking around. If you can wait a few days, it's almost always a good bit less expensive to order whatever you need from Amazon or some other online retailer.

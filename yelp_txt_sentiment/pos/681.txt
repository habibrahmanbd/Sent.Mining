I have only been here a few times now but it is the closest bowling alley to my home and I have kids so there you go.  I never had a problem here and my kids like bowling and the game zone which all cost me a pretty penny but this is a business.  Soda here is almost as much as the movie theater and the food isn't all that good but that is not why you come here.  I will go back when the kids ask and I am grateful to have a nice clean location for bowling near my home.

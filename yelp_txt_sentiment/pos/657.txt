We had been searching for a new place to get our Maltese and Yorkie groomed since we weren't satisfied with our current groomer. I was a little nervous dropping them off but the ladies there are so nice and reassuring!

We couldn't pick them up until the end of the day and they made sure that my dogs had time to play and run and werent in a cage all day. Their haircuts are exactly what we wanted them to be and they looked so cute! They smelled clean and looked so happy. Will definitely be coming back!

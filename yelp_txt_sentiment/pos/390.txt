Last time I was in this area at lunch time, Chao was still being built. Now it's open and today was my first official visit to check things out. I've only tried one entree from the menu, but if the other choices are anything like what I ate today I will definitely be a regular here.

I tried the Pad Kee Mao with chicken. If you don't know what this is, it consists of rice noodles, onion, Thai basil, chili, a little bell pepper and a slice of tomato in there somewhere - all covered in spicy brown sauce. The flavor of this entree was amazing - definitely something I will order again. One of my co-workers decided to eat light and ordered the chicken satay, which he also enjoyed.

Service here was great - Brian took good care of us. They seem to be doing well since they opened. Decent crowd at lunch, but not too packed. I like the layout inside - and the fact that they have a bar means I will definitely be visiting Chao in the near future for happy hour.

Updates to follow after I visit here a few more times!

Absolutely no complaints! Stayed in the Bella Suite with a view. It was a fantastic room; amazing service and friendly staff. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is room service.  Yeah yeah I know and can expect to pay higher prices for room service food, but $34 for hot tea and doughnuts (OUCH!) They charge $5 for room service, but I think that should be free.

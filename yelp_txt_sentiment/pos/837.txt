Very good.  My husband categorized it as "foofy" and, indeed, most of the men looked like they had been dragged there. However, I thought the food was delicious and creative, and almost everything on the menu can be prepared gluten free.  He thought the iced tea was the best he'd ever had.  We strolled down the tracks to the farmers market after lunch and got blackberries, peaches, and a cast iron turtle.

Larry was the best! We recently had our wedding this past weekend and everything went perfect. We had a general idea of the colors we wanted for our wedding but Larry made a few suggestions that really made or tuxes stand out. His service was excellent, he comes to you for everything, this was very beneficial as my dad and groomsmen were from out of town. Larry will come to your house for a fitting, drop the tuxes off and pick them up! Also they were much more affordable then the larger stores. We had a few add ons and I think our total was $165.00 per tux. For the ease of dealing with Larry, it was definitely worth it.

I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.  

As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.

When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!

How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!  

I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts.

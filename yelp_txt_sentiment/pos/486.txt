Second time I have been here,  and the only reason I took a star away,  was because I had to toss my entire takeout dish except the cookie!! I very specifically made sure to say NO BEANS.... Unfortunately,  my food was covered in them!  The service here is very very good... They know their menu and will walk you through finding the order right for you.   The food is very good,  was looking forward to it...  Looks like totinos is lunch today!!

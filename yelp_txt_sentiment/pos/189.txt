This review is for just the gym facilities as I've never tried the tanning or purchased any products. There's a solid array of cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights (including an Olympic lifting platform/power cage combo with bumper plates, another power cage, and a Smith machine). 

The pros: 
24 hours access with your keycard
no-contract membership options
lockers (bring your own lock)
sweat towels provided
friendly employees 

The cons: 
no showers
inconsistent membership rates (my friends got quoted several different rates than what I pay) 
Small space can get packed
Some of the equipment is showing signs of wear (ripped pads on weight machines and cracks in the weight benches pads and the numbers have rubbed off on some of the dumbbells, so you can't tell what the weight is. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to slap some stickers on there but it's been that way for months. 
often dirty - especially the mirrors in front of the power cages which ALWAYS have peoples' spit sprayed all over them. I have personally wiped weird black/brown splotches off the Olympic lifting platform (are people shitting themselves during squats??) and it's always built up again the next time I go.

Overall it's a decent gym that gets the job done if you live in the area.

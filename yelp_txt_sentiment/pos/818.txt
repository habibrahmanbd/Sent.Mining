The food here is DELICIOUS, FLAVORFUL, over all just SUPERB!!! Management and staff are super friendly. We were originally ignored when we walked in everyone was being helped except us. I was upset and almost walked out. I'm so happy we waited! Once the mix up was cleared management went above and beyond to apologize to us and JoJo our waiter was super attentive and made great recommendations. P.S Steve(manager) you are great!!!

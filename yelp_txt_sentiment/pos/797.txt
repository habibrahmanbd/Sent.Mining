Went with a party of six the other night and wasn't sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews.  They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.  There was some confusion with the beer flights ordered but our waiter (who was excellent) quickly corrected.

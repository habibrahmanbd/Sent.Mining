This is such a fun addition to University circle.  I've been here twice; both times to watch football games.  There are at least twenty widescreen tvs here.  Its two stories with bars and bowling lanes on each floor.  They take reservations and have valet  parking.  Both times I got the chicken tenders.  I wouldn't come here specifically for the food but rather for the "activity dining" atmosphere.  Bowling for walk ins is 35$ per hr but 50$ per hr for reservations.  The shoe rental is 3$.  The entrees are 10 to 20$ and mixed drinks around 8 to 10$.  This is my go to place to watch big games.  Bowling here with a group friends will always make for an enjoyable event.

Despite the decor, the food was amazing.  My dad and I had the fajtas the first night we were in Scottsdale and boy were we surprised.   Our waitress was amazing as she told us a unique way to get to the Grand Canyon, which we didn't regret.  Salsa was amazing and my mom probably ate most of it.  If I ever go back, I hopefully will go back there for some Mexican.  Was there on 2/15/2012.

Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! 

I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! 

The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an "ice cream bar," which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.

Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!

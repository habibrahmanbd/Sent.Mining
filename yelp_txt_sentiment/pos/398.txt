There is nothing bad in here !! It's true. Amazing bagels, bakery section, I've always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good. I remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts. I don't know if they make them anymore. Sad . But do go, it's so good .

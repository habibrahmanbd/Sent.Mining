I can't believe I haven't reviewed Sineglazka! They changed my life. I wasn't able to have a cat for 16 years because our older son has severe cat allergies. When I found out about Siberian breed I googled the local breeders and found Sineglazka. We brought my son over and he had 0 reaction from the cats. I fell in love with Kuzma and not even 1 month later he became a part of our family. He's absolutely perfect: potty trained, well-behaved, doesn't scratch our baby, and is gorgeous to look at. Love!

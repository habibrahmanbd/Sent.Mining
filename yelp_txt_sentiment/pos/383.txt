Located at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Great service, fast or slow depending on how busy it is. I ordered beef/broccoli, chicken chow mein soft noodles, & a small wonton soup. I didn't like the green bell pepper in the chow mein (next time I will order without it). Today, I ordered a noodle soup with chicken and vegetables. Definitely, hit the spot. I added some soy sauce and chili for flavor. One of my favorite chinese restaurants'.

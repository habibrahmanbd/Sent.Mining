One of my coworkers mentioned this little spot he heard about not too far from work. So today for lunch a few of us decided to check it out. My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!  Will definitely be a return customer to try out other various customizations on my loaded potato!

When one thinks of sushi in Northeast Ohio, a place on the border of Parma next to a Subway and a convenience store is not going to come to mind. Thankfully though, the check cashing place is no longer there. As a result I had driven past it many a time without a second thought. A few months ago I figured that I might as well give it a shot.

I'm glad I did, to put it lightly. The service has been attentive each time I have been there, and the decor is nice. What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.

As for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.

After eating here, having sushi at the buffets and other restaurants in the area just isn't the same.  It's a must try if you are in the area, especially on Tuesday or Wednesday since one can easily fill up on two of the $3 basic rolls available on those days.

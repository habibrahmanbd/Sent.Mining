We have a friendly little rabbit that we needed taken care of while we went on an 8-day vacation. There were a few options similar to Springbank Pet Resort, but I am glad we chose this place!

We dropped her off in the morning before our flight. They took us to the "bunny and small animals room" where we were allowed to set up her playpen, litterbox, and toys just the way we have it at home. The woman taking care of the small animals was extremely friendly and I felt good about leaving our bunny in her hands. We provided feeding instructions and they put labels on everything so our bag of food and hay wouldn't get mixed with someone else's. 

We picked up our rabbit and she was ready to go for us, in great shape and seemed to be friendlier than when we dropped her off! They did a wonderful job and we will use this place again!

Pros: 
-Rabbits are only $12/day (such a deal for piece of mind)
-Friendly staff 
-Rabbits are kept in their own room away from barking dogs (lower stress).
-Rabbit was in a good mood upon pickup and litterbox was cleaned for us.
-Vet clinic next door (you can sign a waiver in case of medical emergency)

Cons:
-The only con about this place was that the room where the small animals were being kept was not as clean as I think it should have been. When we set up our rabbit, the floors hadn't been mopped in a while and there were rabbit poops on the floor that I had to sweep myself.

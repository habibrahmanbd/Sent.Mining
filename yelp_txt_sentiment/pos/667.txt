A solid 3.5, based on the Chicken Sandwich

I cannot speak about the pizza or pasta, but this sandwich shop is in a really convenient location for me.  I stopped in 'cause I was pressed for time, had to grab a quick dinner, & didn't want Subway/McD's in the plaza.

I asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!

Only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.

Hot green peppers were added as I wanted it spicy.  Very good, especially when it's eaten fresh!

No nonsense sandwich place, hopefully healthier than McD's??  ;)

This is my favorite park in Vegas! 

2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     12/100


I've heard about this park from family and friends over the years, but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year. After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. 

I agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. 

- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. 

- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. 

- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. 

   It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. 

- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.

- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) 

- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. 

- At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. 

- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch. 

- There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. 

- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. 

- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. 

*** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.

I used Red Carpet VIP to set up my friend's bachelor party. The customer service was awesome and all of my phone calls were either answered immediately or I got a call back within the hour. Everything went exactly how they said it would. We scheduled for 3 separate limo pick ups and all 3 were on time and the drivers were awesome and courteous. We also got a hosted entry to XS for that night, with Calvin Harris DJ-ing so it was a crazy line. Getting in was really easy, the host texted me earlier in the evening so I could tell him when we would be getting to XS and then arranged to meet us outside the club and walked us right in past the giant line (even past the endless line for all girl groups) of people waiting hours to see Calvin Harris. Honestly I can not say enough about how painless the whole process was and how awesome all of the staff were throughout the whole process. These guys are now my go to if I need to get in to a crowded event or club in Vegas.

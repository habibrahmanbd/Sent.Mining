Ordered a single KYB AGX strut from Vivid. They had the best price shipped to CA  online so I thought I'd give them a try. There was a minor problem with my paypal account but Vivid was quick to email me about it and also quick to fix the problem. Item arrived promptly and in good condition. Very satisfied with their service and communication. Would not hesitate to order from them again.

This is my favorite place to go for sushi, because of the ambiance, service, and overall quality of the menu items. 

The ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.

Since the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.

The fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.' 

I give Sushi Dining Chopsticks a 5-star rating for being an overall awesome dinner destination.

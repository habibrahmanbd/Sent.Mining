"Good morning, cocktails for you?" 
Wait...what? Oh...it's Vegas!

Dining here, you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess, but in a good way. I'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome. 
Service was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.

Back in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high, but for what you get it's totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future.

I have stayed in so many hotels in vegas and by far for the money you will not find a better hotel room for $220 on a Saturday night. This room was a one bedroom with two flat screens, a 19inch tv in the restroom, a mini bar a restroom big enough for 20 people, shower and deep tub and  even a second restroom. You could have your own party here and could sleep 4-5 if you had to. Its always a speedy check in and out even when there is a line with 15-20 people. This is the only room I have stayed in for under $250 per night and I actually felt like I was in a fancy upscale suite. These are really cool rooms.

I have been here countless times and keep coming back. All of my friends are hooked too. Delicious salads, bowls, burgers, wraps, and desserts--all vegan! Best items include black bean burrito, buddha bowl, ace of kales salad, quinoa onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the vanilla cupcake. Always busy but totally worth it.

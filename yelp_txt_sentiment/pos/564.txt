Now that is off season for summer take advantage of the 49.00 tune up.  Just had mine done today.  We also just purchased a condo for my mom and the inspector from our realtor's referral  was not allowed on the roof as an inspector to check the unit, so we hired Dukes of Air and it needed a $300 repair that the seller will have to fix.

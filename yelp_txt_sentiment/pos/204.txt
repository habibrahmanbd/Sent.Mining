Came in because our Toronto friends insisted on drinking some "gator bait" before we left to go home. This place screams New Orleans to me, and the service is friendly just like the south. We sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us, pretty cool. 

Didn't try the food but the menu looked tasty, will try it when we are back in town. But the "gator bait" drink was delicious!

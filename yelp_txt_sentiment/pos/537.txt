My regular cleanings are smooth and I've always appreciated the timeliness of each appointment. Any work performed on my teeth have been pain free and effortless which very much appreciated. 

Overall, great atmosphere !!! Friendly staff across the board, relaxing background music and top notch dental care that delivered an enjoyable experience.

We've always been customers of Petco. We like the layout and the products they carry. Of course you can find some of the products cheaper elsewhere but we're fans of "one-stop-shop". One of our dogs comes here for his monthly wash and brushout, they ladies are great with him. They also have a woman who is "certified" for cats, didn't know you needed to be certified but I guess it's a good idea. Friendly staff and a great dog trainer too!

Fitness together

I can say nothing but positive things about my experience at fitness together Steele creek. The facility is clean and well equipped and the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality. When my wife and I first showed up, we had a deal to try five sessions for 99 dollars. We had talked for a while about joining a gym, but fitness together is so much more. It's like a community of people working toward a common goal of getting fit and taking control of their health. The owner, Joe, is very knowledgeable in fitness, exercise, and most importantly nutrition. He worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals. Included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage, fitness levels, resting heart rate, flexibility, and a few other factors. Additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation. It is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness. At first I dreaded going to exercise, but after seeing the positive changes you just can't wait to get back. I like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment, but I must say I continue to add additional sessions. This is mainly because I continue to see results. My wife and I are both stronger, healthier, and happier thanks to Joe and his knowledgeable and helpful staff. I highly recommend Fitness Together to anyone looking to get into shape, tone up, lose some inches or lbs. it's been a great experience.

Great noodle spot! I love the vibe and friendly service. I forgot what the dish is called but I got the beef with vegetables and noodles. It was amazing, after a long day at work and you feeling asian food come here. Decent wait time for food, knowing that it's freshly made noodles made the wait worth it. My dish also came a little soup which was a good pairing. I tried the soup my acquaintance ordered and found it quite salty which was weird because it looked like the same broth that came with my dish. Maybe it was the meat? The environment itself was ok, when it gets busy it's super cramped. I found the main wooden soup spoon way too big for my mouth. I think that spoon was made for Matt Stonie or Kobayashi. Overall good food, good service!

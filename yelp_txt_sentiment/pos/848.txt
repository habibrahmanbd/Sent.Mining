They come out to our construction site everyday. The food is reliable, tasty, and appropriately priced. What really brings this place over the top is the people who work for them. There are two women who come out to our site on 44th St everyday and they are so sweet and friendly. Couldn't ask for anything more from a food truck. Plus it appears to be solar powered. That is a plus.

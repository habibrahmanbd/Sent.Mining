What's to say! It's a grocery store with what ya need downtown. It's not hipster or shady..it's just a good, simple grocery store with a great mix of produce, organic and other baked goods. The prices are fair even though some things I know are cheaper elsewhere; for many of us it means not having to drive so its all good.

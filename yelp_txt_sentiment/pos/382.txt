I will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated. A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.

I thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.

As for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.

The service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.

There was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.

If you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back.

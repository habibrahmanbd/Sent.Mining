This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus "tapas" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the "Halal" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!

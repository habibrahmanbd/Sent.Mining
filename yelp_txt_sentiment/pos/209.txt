This is a really quaint place for the whole family!  Rows of pinball machines- some vintage, some modern. There are also other various arcade games like Super Mario Bros. and Centipede.  Crane games for all your plushie needs.  Coin machines to turn your bills into coins for the machines.  Vending machines in case you are feeling hungry or thirsty while you play.  Staff walks around to make sure machines are running as they should and refund you if one of them fails while you are playing.  Towards the back, there are more older pinball machines that seem to be out of order or in the process of restoration.. really neat to see!  I believe there is also a prize counter in the back though I'm not sure how that would work.  It is a dimly lit building which allows the lights of the machines to illuminate the area.. Great place to hang out and play some good ol' fashioned arcade games.

I can't do Italian food unless it made by my mother, grandmother, or grandfather. All who descend from Sicily. However, this place silences even the most difficult critics. Each dish made with care, the kitchen obviously has a deep respect for this cuisine. And the employees treat you like family. Overall an authentic Italian experience.

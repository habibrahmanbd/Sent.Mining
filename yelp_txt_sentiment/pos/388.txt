There are two Giant Eagles nearby. The gargantuan Market District over in Village Square and this one.

I would choose this one 9/10 times over the other.

That lone other time is in the event I run out of a special shaving soap that only seems to be sold there. I don't particularly like Giant Eagle unless I'm armed with coupons. They double coupons, but their regular prices are high.

But this particular Giant Eagle had one huge bonus: their bakery makes really good everything bagels... Better than the ones from the other Giant Eagle market district, even though that bakery is huge and fancy. Even before their renovation, I would go there just for bagels. Their donuts are just like other Giant Eagle bakery donuts...really good. Personally, I prefer them over Dunkin. 

The store is recently renovated, clean, and normal in size.

Oh my gosh.. BOMBBBBBBBB!!! This place is so amazing!! The food is incredible! I have had almost everything on the menu. They have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes. The first time you go in, tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces. My two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic. The staff is incredibly friendly and personable. The restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat. Go check it out you will not be disappointed!

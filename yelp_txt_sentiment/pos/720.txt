Played an 18-hole round on a Saturday during the mid morning several weeks ago.   The starter got us off on time, so that is always a good thing.

The course as mentioned is previously is 27 holes (three 9 hole courses) along with an Executive course.  We played Red to Blue that day.  The course is fairly wide open but there are some tight holes where a well placed drive will be key.  There are some holes with a few blind shots, but this is not the norm.  There are some water holes and some well placed bunkers.  

Overall the course was in really good shape.  Tee boxes and greens were well kept.  There are some burnt out patches on the fairways, but nothing significant.  

My only 'gripe' would be a pace of play.  The course is very crowded and yes, I went at the a time where it is even more crowded.  We played in just over 5 hours, which is too long, but there was really no place to go.  There is no beverage cart service either, so it is wise to load up prior to going out or at the turn.

Price was a little expensive, coming in at $55 for 18 and a cart (weekend rates).  Overall, I like coming here, the course is usually in great condition and the employees are always polite and professional.

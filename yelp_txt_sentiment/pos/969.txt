When the power steering pump went out on our 2005 BMW 325i one Friday evening, we needed to find someone to repair it asap. Unfortunately 99% of the mechanics that specialize in BMW's were closed on the weekend. We hestitatly brought it into the dealership and was quoted over a grand for the repair. It was too much for our budget. Thankfully for us, we called around and stumbled upon Arthur and his shop. He quoted us HALF of what the dealership would've charged us. Not only was it the best deal in town, Arthur was super knowledgable, honest, friendly, and accommodating to our needs. We needed the car back by Monday so he was able to order the parts on Saturday, came in on his day off on Sunday to repair it, and had it ready for us first thing Monday morning. Super impressed with his work and customer service. He was honest and didn't try to up-sell any extra unneccessary services, which we deeply appreciated. We highly recommend and will definitely be a returning customer. Thank you Arthur!

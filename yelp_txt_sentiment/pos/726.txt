I've been to the Ajax location and didn't have the best experience. I would still give the Ajax location another try because maybe I just had them on an off day. The butter chicken was not creamy and did not have enough sauce in it at all, chicken was dry.

THIS location on the other hand, the interior was clean, staff were very friendly (not that they werent at the other location) The butter chicken was so delicious! The white meat was well cooked, moist on the inside, the portion of sauce to meat was perfect and the sauce was seasoned with all of the right ingredients making it so creamy.

I also really enjoyed the chicken poutine. It had lots of flavour and im a fan of their fries, crispy and yummy.

I would go back to this location! :)

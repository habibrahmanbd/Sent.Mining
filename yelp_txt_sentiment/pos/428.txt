Had a fantastic experience at this barber shop. Claude was fantastic and is such a great person to talk to while in the chair. This is an art to him, not just a haircut. He takes his time and has great conversation with his patrons. Such a wealth of knowledge on the area, and such a fantastic person to talk to. Greatly appreciated his service and his skill. Kudos to Claude!!!

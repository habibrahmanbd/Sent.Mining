I stopped in here the other night before a movie, without having done any research or prior yelping, which is very unusual and risky for me! The menu is vast, and prices pretty decent for the area, selection, and ambiance. I had the drunken noodles with beef and a HUGE portion was delivered. Tender wide rice noodles arranged on a bed of fresh veggies, wood ear mushrooms, lettuce, and flavorful beef. Around $13 w/ tax + tip I believe, quite the bargain and provided me with leftovers! Would go back if I was in the area.

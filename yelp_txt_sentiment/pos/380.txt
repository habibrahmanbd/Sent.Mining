I've had 3 other laser tattoo removals before I came here so I know what I should be getting. Honestly she didn't even go over it all the way with the laser. There's quite a bit of the tattoo that's untouched. I'll be going somewhere else for the remainder. It's not worth the pain if it's not even going to make a difference.

I admit that I haven't tried ALL the italian restaurants in Toronto... but of the ones that I have tried, Ciao has been the place that I've gone to multiple times. 

Why? Let me count the ways:
1. Reserved table is always ready 
2. Amazing service
3. Fabulous Wine Selection
4. The patio feels so European in the Summer
5. The portions are huge!
6. The quality and taste of the food is amaze
7. It's in Yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk
8. The olives with the bread - delish!

I feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but I also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!

ps. Be sure to order the Mushroom Risotto - it's divine!!

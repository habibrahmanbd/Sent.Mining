I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience. 

To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win. 

As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty. 

We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us. 

A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas. 

Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot. 

Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.

Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for? 

This was my second time at HuHot, and I'll be back for more.

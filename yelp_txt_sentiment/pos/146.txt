We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back. 

It is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling. 

The wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. 

If we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place.

When I compare Over Easy with other places, maybe I don't find it my ultimate Sunday morning family breakfast place, but I'd definitely drop by with my pals for some home-style fries once in a while...

Everything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast, and that's why I gave it 4-stars.

The waitresses are really nice and friendly, which is the kick start of a good morning.

Go with "The Big Breakfast" for ~$12 if you're hungry, and I'm telling you, you'd be pretty full by the end of it you wouldn't want lunch!

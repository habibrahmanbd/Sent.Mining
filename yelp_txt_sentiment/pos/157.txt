I ate at New India Bazaar for dinner. I took it to go. I ordered samosa, pani puri chaat, and gobi. The samosas were very good and very big! The main dish, gobi was really great. As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken, but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before, so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy, but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant. I noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts. I plan to come back to shop. They  have the best prices that I've seen on neem toothpastes.

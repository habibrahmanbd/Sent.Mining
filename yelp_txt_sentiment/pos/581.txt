We arrived here at 10:00am and weren't able to get a full tour until 1:00pm, so we opted for the mini tour.

It was very informative and interesting. It starts with a brief video about the dam which lasts about 10 minutes. Then you are led to a line where you wait for your tour to begin. The take you down the elevator into the depths of the dam. You get to see all the workings and information about how it was built. The our guides are entertaining as well- as dam entertaining as you can be about a dam tour. LOL

After the tour concludes you are allowed to walk outside and see the dam from a great viewpoint. Awesome time to take pictures and really enjoy the massive beauty of this place. There is also a small exhibit inside which tells you more about how Hoover Dam was built and what it took. It is so amazing that people built this place so long ago and the horrendous conditions they had to endure. just standing outside in late July- temperatures topped 106 but in the sun it felt like 120.

Once you are done exploring the inside exhibits and views, you can wander outside and walk the dam. Beware that when you leave the dam touring area, you cannot return, it is a one way only exit. 

I recommend bringing lots of waters and hats, as the heat made exploring the dam outside almost unbearable.

After checking the outside of the dam, we walked over to little souvenir shop and bought some items. By that time, we were hot and starved, so we stopped at the small deli/snack shop at the dam and snagged a table to eat lunch. Beware it can get very crowded. We ordered a small deli sandwich and some chicken tenders/fries for the kids.

TIP: Bring your own bagged lunch and sit on the shaded areas/benches during your walk of the dam to really enjoy the experience. There is a Subway on your drive in to stop at.

This was a memorable, amazing visit and is one of those places you see that you will remember forever.

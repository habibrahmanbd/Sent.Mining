My iPad Air screen was completely smashed, so I researched screen repairs.  Needless to say, it was very expensive to repair.  I stumbled upon this shop on the internet, I read up on them and they appeared to be a legitimate business.  Eventhough I was nervous to ship out my iPad, I shipped it to them (insurance and signature confirmation). They received it on a Friday, and I got it back the next Friday.  
I received my iPad Air back in pristine and like-new condition.  It had been packed nicely and securely upon arrival.
Thank you, I am so happy to have my iPad again with a new screen.

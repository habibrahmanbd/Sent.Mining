I love Savers - the deals are great and the staff is positive. There is good quality and you don't see much of anything with stains, etc. on them. Everyone has a great attitude and it's clean.

We made a special trip to Vegas this past weekend from LA and hit ALL local Savers including the one in Henderson. Almost $600 later I am now dealing with adhesive for four pair of boots and 10 pairs of shoes!

While Savers deserves five stars, the adhesive on the back of the price tags is very hard to remove and the frustration level is palpable. When they put it on the inside of the shoe bottom, and you try to remove it, it leaves a gooey residue that is all but fun when you slip on a pair of shoes in warm weather and your foot is sweaty. Ignoring the schmuck sound when you lift up your foot to walk due to it sticking to the shoe, it doesn't feel very good.

You can put these price tags directly on leather and they don't stick because leather breathes. It's the synthetic material they use for the inside of shoes where adhesive really only does "its thing" leading to frustration.

I still love your stores anyway but this would be a great help and not so frustrating!

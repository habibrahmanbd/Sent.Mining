I recently visited Pieology for the first time with friends recently and was really pleased with the selection and taste of the pies. For a set price you can pick your crust, base sauce and toppings, regardless of the amount and variety. The pizzas are made to order and placed in the oven for maybe 5-10 minutes.  There are gluten-free options as well for those that need.  

Overall I'd have to say I'm a fan of Pieology now and will return in the future.  Staff is friendly and efficient. It was a relatively quiet late afternoon so the wait was negligible.  Check it out.

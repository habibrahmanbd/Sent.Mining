Todays Energy Store did a great job on our Solar Installation. Owner Marc Hale and his crew were prompt, did a very clean looking install and cleaned up everything before they left each day. We are very happy with our purchase and they stand behind their product. So if you are tired of your monthly Electric Bill, call Todays Energy and get a quote, you will be glad you did.

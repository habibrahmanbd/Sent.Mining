I've been to Snug on numerous occasions, and I do enjoy my time when I go! However, I believe that the menu does need an update. For the prices they are serving, and the beautiful location, the food is not on par. The crab cakes are amazing, and I've had my fair share of fish, steak, ahi tuna, good but not amazing. 

Come for a good meal and beautiful location, but after being there many times, menu needs an update! I hope the chefs see this! Hope they are not cutting corners.

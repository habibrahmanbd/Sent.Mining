I purchased a used safe on Craigslist.  Not just any safe mind you.  Oh no, I HAD to have the super high security 4000 lb bank safe ... especially at the dirt cheap price it was listed.

Let me say that again - FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS.  Two tons.  About the same as a Toyota Highlander.  5 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and about 35 inches deep.

I spent several days calling around to places to get it moved.  No one wanted to touch this thing.  Then I called The Safe Keeper.

Don (the owner) agreed to do it for $800.  More than I wanted to spend, because I'm a cheapskate.  I finally agreed since no one else would take the job.

I'M GLAD I DID!!

Don and 3 of his guys picked it up from a warehouse near the strip, moved it to my home in Centennial.  They used two pallet jacks, an assortment of wood blocks and chocks, and floor coverings.  Four turns and one 36 inch wide doorway later, they had it placed EXACTLY where I wanted it.  No scuffed walls.  No indentations in the linoleum.  No damage to persons or property whatsoever.  

Not a lot impresses me.  (See my other reviews.)  But these guys did.  Folks, the whole crew were professional safe movers who worked seamlessly together.

FIVE STARS.  ALL THE WAY.  CALL THEM WHEN YOU NEED A SAFE MOVED.

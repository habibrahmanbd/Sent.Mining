This is the best Chinese Restaurant in Summerlin. The Dim Sum is made fresh on demand. However the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc
Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience 
I have to add to this review. Everything is fresh and delicious. You can carry out or eat in. You must try this restaurant

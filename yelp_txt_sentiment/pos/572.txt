This is my go-to grocery store when I am too lazy to head to Winco. I have been here well over a hundred times, and the experience is pretty standard for Smith's stores in my experience.

I have never had a problem with stocking here, which is good. Items are always stocked well, regardless of when in the week you come. I am not the biggest fan of their produce however. About 20% of the time, I bring how green beans or asparagus, and two days later they are covered in mold (and no, it is not my refrigerator). So I no longer purchase produce here except for when I am in a bind. Store is also always clean, I have never once seen a spill or poorly arranged merchandise, which is a testament to the hard working staff. 

The staff are always very helpful and friendly. They don't always have enough baggers, but last time I was there they had plenty, and wouldn't even let me unload my cart (they had a separate person in the aisle that unloaded people's carts for them). First time I've experienced that and it was pretty great. 

Prices are a bit on the high side overall, I would not shop here if you do not use your Smith's card. The prices are outrageous with out it. However, they end up being pretty reasonable when you remember to use the gas points (which is now made easier by the Smith's gas station located directly in front of this store). 

They DEFINITELY need way more cart corrals in the parking lot. Like at least double the amount they currently have. There are none closer to the gas station, and when the store is busy people are too lazy to walk their carts back to the corrals, and I've seen carts fly into parked cars on at least three separate occasions. I hope Smith's management reads this review and fixes this problem soon.

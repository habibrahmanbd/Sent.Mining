I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions. Just went to Vegas this past weekend and had a blast.

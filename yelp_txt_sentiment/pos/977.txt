For the average person, it's hard finding a good automotive shop to take care of your precious vehicle. Jesus, Mat, James and the rest of the guys here at Just Brakes took me in immediately as a walk in and made quick  work of what I needed done on my car. Initially, I was trying to make the most of my day off and didn't have a lot of time to wait around. Jesus insisted that he could get it done on the spot. I needed a simple alignment but what I received was far more then that. All of the guys here brought me to the back of the store and gave me a couple burgers while I waited, being that it was Super Saturday where their vendors treat them to a meal of their choosing. They treated me like family and their dedication to making the customer happy will bring me back here every time I need work done. From struts and shocks,  to oil changes and tire rotations. This is the place I'll be taking my vehicle to.

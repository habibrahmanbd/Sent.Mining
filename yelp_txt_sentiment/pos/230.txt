Good, clean place to get a mani/ pedi. The two came to $39 with tax and they did a great job of both. TVs all over so you can watch tv and freindly staff. 

Will be going back for my next mani/pedi.

**** UPDATE*****

The great manicure that I got here lasted all the way through my vacation to Mexico without  so much as a chip! This was a regular manicure and not done with shellac.

Only now, after two days back to work and polishing mad silverware, is it starting to chip. I'm upping the stars from my former 4 to 5.

Very impressed and will be returning with friends :)

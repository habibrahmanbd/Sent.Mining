Just moved to Phoenix. Stopped at Hinckley's for some much needed lighting and fan advice. Was not disappointed!  Bridgett was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Some of my current needs they could meet and for the others Bridgett had great advice. This will be my #1 stop for lighting for as long as I'm in Phoenix. And BTW don't think that because they're specialists that they are more expensive. Prices are very competitive.

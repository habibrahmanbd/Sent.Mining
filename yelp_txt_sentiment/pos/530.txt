First, I love barbecue so. Second, I love any place that serves you a pile of meat on a tray. I am a simple creature. 

Naked BBQ was fun, fast, and tasty. The staff was ridiculously nice and fun. As for the food, the sides are bit lackluster and need a bit more of a spicy punch or additional creamy, fatty goodness.  But, that is totally okay as the meat is the real star here. We tried four options, and we agreed that we both liked the brisket the most. Pulled pork and chicken were tasty as well. Overall, it was a fun, casual lunch with the before mentioned meat on a tray. I would totally stop by here for lunch or a brisket pick-up adventure again.

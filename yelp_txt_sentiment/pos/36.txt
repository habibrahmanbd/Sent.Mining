This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.

After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.  
Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back

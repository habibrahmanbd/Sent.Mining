Harlow's serves up a simple, thin crust pizza that gives you that real authentic Italian feel. They have a limited menu (a handful of pizzas and drinks, no substitutions allowed), but you are bound to get a good pie no matter what. My girlfriend and I got 2 pizzas (the margherita and the bianca), ate both, and left feeling satisfied without being stuffed. The pizza has a great, clean taste while staying light and fresh. The interior is just as fun and bright as the pizzas with a New Mexico feel (cacti and animal skulls with peach painted walls) and has a large front window they keep open when the weather is nice. Definitely stop by when you're looking for a nice light pizza.

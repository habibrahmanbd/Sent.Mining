I went to pep boys at 6pm on the saturday of thansgiving weekend when everything else was closed. So first off, the store hours and accessibility in times of need was awesome. 
Herold was the customer services rep who helped us out and he was a very very big help. He got everything done and really understood the urgency of the problem (I had to drive 550 miles to SC the next day). He was delightful to talk to and was very patient and understanding as well.

Dustin was the technical rep who handled my case and was very helpful as well. He really understood my budget limits and had very affordable solutions to my problems. 

I would rate these guys 5 stars because of the professional, friendly and understanding way in which they handled the matter. Oh, and we were also able to get big discounts on parts and labor which is always awesome. 

Thank you so much pep boys (especially Herold and Dustin), noone else has ever responded to an SOS call like you did.

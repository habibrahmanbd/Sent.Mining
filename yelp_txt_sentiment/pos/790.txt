Was on the far West side of town and wanted to try something different then the norm. My daughter and I stopped in to grab a bite. I had the Hawaiian Dog and Euro Fries, she had a plain hot dog with ketchup (boring). Anyway I was a little surprised when everything rang up to a little over $25 dollars, but hey like I said not the norm, right? Well the food was really good and tasty and worth it! Check out the pics.

So good! They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory. 
The decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening.
We got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious. 
I would definitely go again if given the chance.

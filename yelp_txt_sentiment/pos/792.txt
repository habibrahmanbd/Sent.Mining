This was the absolute best meal (and cocktails) I've ever had.  Chic atmosphere and great date spot. Do yourself a favor and add this restaurant to your Must Eats!!!

Our server, Brandon gave us the best recommendations and we couldn't have been more pleased with his service. 

MUST EATS: Trios of Picos and get the side of Guac. It comes with chips, plantains and arepas ... Chicharrones - my boyfriend said these were the best wings he's ever had! The onions and sauce made the dish!! For entrees, get the Braised Short Rib and Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. We both agree they were phenomenal. 

MUST DRINK: Chica-Rita - holy cow - the most amazing drink!!!! Not on the menu, but Brendon also whipped us up a Mezcal Old Fashioned, which was nothing short of perfect.

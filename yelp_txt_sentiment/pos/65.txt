Early this past January, I needed to find a furnished rental in the uptown Charlotte market. I really had no idea of how or where to look. I was glad when I found the Sold on Charlotte site.
As I recall I traded a few emails and phone calls with Chip and he was helpful in answering all my questions. We met at 626 North Graham and he showed me the unit there that was available.
Between Chip and Sylvia, I was "sold" on that apartment and we got the "paperwork" going. I enjoyed my stay there which lasted 6 months (3 months more that I initially signed up for).
When it came time to give my notice, Sylvia gave me all the details I needed, and these were pretty much the same that were in our initial Lease Agreement. They were kind enough to give me ample notice to show the apartment during my last 30 days, without too much inconvenience. Sylvia helped me tie up a few loose ends and even arranged to pick up a lamp for me that needed to be repaired when I moved out.
 
I would certainly reach out to the team at Sold on Charlotte again.
 
Kind regards,

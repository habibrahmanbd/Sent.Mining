I would give these ladies a 10 if I could! I consider myself a good cleaner but when we have them come monthly the job they do is MAGICAL - I get giddy when I walk into our home and see how beautiful it looks. Attention to detail is an understatement - it almost looks like new faucets and knobs are installed each time they come. They did our two bedroom two bath in under two hours and are so sweet. They take "clean" to a whole new level. I LOVE THEM!

Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!

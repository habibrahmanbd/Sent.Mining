So far so good...19.99 gets  you and a guest in. The staff is nice and friendly. This place is way cleaner then the other gyms in the area. Only downside is that this place gets hot . seems to be a crap ac or something..
But overall the experience is pretty okay...

Tip place gets super packed from 5~9

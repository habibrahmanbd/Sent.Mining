Their red velvet cupcakes are AMAZING! Their buttercream frosting is fantastic and I also like their brownies when they have them. The location couldn't be better. I'd say you couldn't find a more romantic date-spot. I won't give them 5 stars though, since I have had some dry cupcakes in the past and they seem to always run out of the good stuff (mostly the red velvet) on weekends which is the only time I can make it over there.

Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house, with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.

We started with the Famous Cheese Toast, oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare, which was made table side and served with small biscuits.

We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.

Our server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.

The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.

In conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg.

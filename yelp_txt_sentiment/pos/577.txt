This was a great find near Pittsburgh alternative to down town scene. Ambiance was great on the deck by the river, and service was excellent (Thanks Melisa for history lessens!). Seafood including Oysters were fresh and well prepared. Price was reasonable for "Prefix" menu including scrumptious dessert.  What an evening to end a fantastic summer day in Pittsburgh.

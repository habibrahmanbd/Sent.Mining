Michael from Red Carpet VIP is amazing ! I reached out because I needed help planning my soon to be sister in law's bachelorette. It was a group of 10 girls so I was a little overwhelmed but Michael saved the day! Everything was super smooth and easy! We got good deals and had the best time ever! We booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price. I have saved contact info because I will for sure reach out again on next Vegas trip!!!

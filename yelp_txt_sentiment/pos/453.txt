After an afternoon hike along the Don River, we were in dire need of some sweet sweet therapy.  Close proximity to downtown we decided to venture towards Lickadee Split on Coxwell.  I have a soft-spot for soft-serve and confectioneries! With a ton of selections to choose from Lickadee Split is a classic, popular and awesome joint for some cool treats if you're ever in the east-end of the city. 
Beware their one scoop is a MASSIVE one, thankfully the person helping me recommended I first see their quantity before being so keen on jumping on the two-scoop-wagon.  Thankfully One was enough, both Jen and I each took something we liked.
Chocolate Fudge was for her.  Over-decadent, every chocolate-lovers love! 

Gold Ribbon- mix of caramel, chocolate, and vanilla, I truly loved this trio of flavor, each complemented one another. TRULY delicious!

So many great this about Yoga Factory! Excellent teachers, very friendly and professional; they have been very patient with my practice but know how to push me to meet my goals. Amazing location very easily accessible very easy city parking! Nice large space in the hot room, never did I feel like my elbow room was compromised and the room can get PACKED! The facility is clean, neat and I love the choice of decor. Highly recommended for a first-timer or for someone who has a frequent practice very friendly and welcoming place.

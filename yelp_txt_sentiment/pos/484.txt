Got a pepperoni and sausage half sheet pizza from here last weekend and it was delicious. The pepperoni was awesome! The sausage pieces are huge like small meatballs. The sauce is thick and sweet which I like. Tons of cheese on this pizza which caused me to have an upset stomach aftward. Not their fault. I didn't go into the building to pick up the pizza so I can't say what it's like to eat in.

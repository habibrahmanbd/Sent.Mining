Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!

After a month of searching crappy places, Internet sales, tent events, awkward warehouses, my boyfriend and I came across this places as we were tossing up the white flag on our way to Ikea. It's clean, straight forward, and Chuck our sales guy was super helpful and not pushy. While they do have discounted and clearance mattresses they are the only ones I've found that give a 10 year warranty AND a 30 day comfort trial period on all their mattresses. How rad is that? I'd totally recommend them to anyone. :) thanks guys for making this so easy, wish we came here first!

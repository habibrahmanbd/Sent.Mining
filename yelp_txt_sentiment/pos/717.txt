Parking is a little tricky, but it's totally worth it for this local gem! I'm a traditional sesame and cream cheese kind of girl, but the friendly guy at the counter suggested the pimento BLT on asiago, and I went for it. Hot and melty and crispy and quite possibly this BEST bagel sandwich I have ever had. I want it again tomorrow!

My kids took me here for my birthday dinner. 

I had the gigantic pork chop and generous helpings of mashed potatoes and rice. Yes, I know that's a LOT of starch but one of them was a substitute for -- I think -- Brussel sprouts, which I do NOT eat.

But it was DELICIOUS.

I had been craving a pork chop for months. 

Thanks Harevey's for a great night.

Great quality of food!! The plates looked very clean and appetizing. The fish were fresh and was well proportioned with the rice - which I'm kind of particular about. Very nice service as well.

Parking is a bit tight and there is also limited seating especially during peak dinner hours.

Definitely would like to try take-out next time.

We dropped by in hopes of finding Atkinson's Peanut Butter Bars(we first tried them From Honey Salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes, we found it. 

I was also bummed that stores didn't carry Peanut Butter Twix anymore, but now I'm happy that they can also be found at Rocket Fizz.. On our way out, wifey grabbed an RC Cola and I tried a Key Lime Pie soda which was pretty good.

If you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find, there's a good chance you'll find it here. If only Now and Later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy, and If Tidal Wave Gum came back to life...The Green Apple was my favorite!......ALOHA!!!

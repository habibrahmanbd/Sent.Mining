With fresh beer and seafood and service is really good here as they have an upstairs and a downstairs. I find that this location is usually packed; why not be they're so good. Food portions here go by the pound. This restaurant is a really good location for someone who truly loves to eat seafood. I will definitely be going back in the near future.

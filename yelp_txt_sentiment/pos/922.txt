I'm in love with their vegan pizza...soy sausage, BBQ sauce, and red onions, oh my! My only complaint is the crust...it's not great...sometimes I think it tastes like cardboard (that's why 4 stars and not 5). The toppings definitely make up for it though. I'm not sure what the crust is missing, but I wish it was better (or maybe not because then I'd be ordering pizza more often!!).

We have never been there in person--always gotten delivery. The delivery is fast...usually around 45 minutes. Once they forgot my soy sausage and the replacement pizza was here in 20 minutes. Great service!

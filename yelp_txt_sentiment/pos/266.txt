I really like this bookstore for its DVD and music selections. There's a nice clearance section with top end DVDs going for only two dollars. The staff here is very pleasant, and it's clean and well organized. I can't speak for their book section, as I have yet to shop for books here. They also have gadgets, which is nice. It's easy to find parking outside. My one complaint, if any, would be that they apparently don't check for the regions of their DVDs. I've purchased several which weren't made for the US region, so it was a total waste of money. Overall, I really like shopping here, and I'd recommend it to anyone who asked.

I love coming to pastel ! My favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe. Their waffles are good too, but I personally like crepes more. The ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which I like. I recently tried their matcha batter crepe, it wasn't bad, but I prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream.

I think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area. The outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer.

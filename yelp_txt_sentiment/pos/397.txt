I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days, when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.

My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.

Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.

The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though.

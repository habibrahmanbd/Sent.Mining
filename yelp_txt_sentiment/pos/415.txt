BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. 

Pros: 

* Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter 
* Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows
* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) 
* Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw
   Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste
* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. 
  Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) 
  We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming 
* Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable
* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable
* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken
* Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors 
  I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders 
* Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip
* Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks 

Cons: 

* It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.

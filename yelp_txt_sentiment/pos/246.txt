We were recommended this Vet by a friend who has gone to him for years; and we are not disappointed.

Doctor Youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach. He shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being.

He is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet. If they are overweight, he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm. If you are an uptight suburbian, then don't go to him. He will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'Puppocinos'. Which you are.

I started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet, who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or sedate her for check ups. I felt that was ridiculous and brought her to Doctor Youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff. He has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it. 

His prices are very fair, and he himself is the most trustworthy vet I have yet to meet. One conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money, he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals.

I love this guy so much I recommended him to my best friend when she got her cat, and she takes it to him as well. She got the cat spayed and he offered to keep it overnight for free!

It is a drive away for me, but is well worth it. I would drive to Boulder City if I had to just to keep this guy as my vet.

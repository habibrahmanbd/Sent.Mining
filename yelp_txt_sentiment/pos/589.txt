This review is only for take out matza ball soup. Real hot and tasty on rainy day. Some suggestions, though:  have sturdier containers for hot soup. Clear plastic are flimsy and can cause burns.  Need plastic soup spoons, teaspoons say we didn't plan for soup!  Also, I think cashier said bagel chips come with soup, but none were in bag.
Indoor parking is the best on rainy days. 
A good work in progress.

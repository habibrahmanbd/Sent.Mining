I remember going to this salon a few years ago and I loved how fast thier service was(under 45 min). I'm glad that that hasn't changed. I did a refill on my seaweed bio gel nails with an air brushed french manicure because I saw it here on yelp and I didn't even know that was an option. My nail tech was nice she understood what I wanted and was very fast( without sacrificing quality). Sadly my only complain is that this place is located in markham which is out of my way. It would be cool if they opened up another location in the north York or downtown area.

This place has a dang good Philly - which I should hope, since that's their game.  First time I went in the kid taking my order had no clue what he was doing, writing it down on a scrap of cardboard and severely lacking customer service skills.  But the sandwich came out great (and surprisingly, accurate).  Went in a second time a month or two later, and the gal was friendly and helpful - way better experience than the first time.  Again, the sandwich came out fantastic.  

I found the prices to be reasonable as well, especially for a little mom-and-pop shop like this.  Definitely worth the stop, and next time I'm craving a Philly, this is where I'm headed.

After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off, a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.  

Wine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.

I'd be a regular if living in the area.

Don't let the location or the look of the building fool you. When I tell you this is THE BEST PLACE FOR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN EATS! I cannot stop eating their taco gringos Omg so yummy and everything is cooked to order right in front of you. This is the only place that can compare to the Hispanic food in California! You have to try it! DEFINITELY DESERVES MORE THAN 5 stars!!!!

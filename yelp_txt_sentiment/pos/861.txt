We came here one evening.  We were starving and not feeling like cooking.  I was pretty happy with my food.  I ordered from the menu that's above the cashier.  I can't complain about the portion size, it was a massive box of rice and 2 big meat kebob things.  I'm glad I read Bilal's review, because I asked about the white sauce and they gave it to me.  Also it was $9.99 + tax or something crazy.  I was stuffed!  I wish I could remember what it was called, but I think it was the second from the right and it started with an "S".  (I clearly should have taken a picture) or the menu.  One thing...they said it would be ready in 10 minutes, it took like 20.  I think they think it takes 10 but it doesn't.

So, this is actually not my first time here... came here a few times already and food is pretty good.  No complaints at all.  You come here for the curries and their rotis.  

We ordered the beef brisket curry, a fried rice and 2 extra orders of roti.  I wish there was just a bit more beef in the curry.  Other than that, things were pretty good.

A little on the expensive side.  The portions were a bit small for the prices they are charging.  I guess they can get away with it, their food is pretty good after all.

Will I come back...  yes.  But will not go out of way to come here.  I don't usually have cravings for curry (never did).  

I am always finding things on the small side lately... no idea why!

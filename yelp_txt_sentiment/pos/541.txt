Sexy, swanky Art Deco/Craftsman interiors with nightly piano.
Serene patio seating for fireside canoodling, sunset viewing or enjoying the early desert spring weather.
Service was attentive, quick and friendly.  The sunset margarita was a fruity and refreshing retreat and went perfectly with my awesome chicken quesadilla.
If I wasn't at the Biltmore for work you would've found me here or at the pool my entire stay in Phoenix.

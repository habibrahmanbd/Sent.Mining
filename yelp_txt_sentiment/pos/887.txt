The service is good for a very busy Chinese restaurant. They gave you a lot of food for the price. All the food item we ordered are above average. I love the fact that they have revolving door, so that the cold does not come in when people go in and out; and they also have a large waiting area which is really a life safer when you have to wait for 20 min with the deep freeze outside.

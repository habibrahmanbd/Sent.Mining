As an ex-NYer, I have a pretty high standard of bagel. These did not disappoint, but I wouldn't say they are truly singular in their yumminess. My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed "fresher" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.

But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don't get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.

The shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn't bad. 

All in all, I will be back again to try more.

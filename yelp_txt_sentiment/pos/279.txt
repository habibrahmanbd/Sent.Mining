Lovely food. I am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery.. they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for. Great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians.
Fact that this location is in tempe marketplace, makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings.

As a resident of Mountains Edge, its obvious we are missing the necessities....Trader Joe's (I'll even settle for a Sprouts), Costco or a NICE big gym...BUT what we do have is this place!!  Barking Dogs is the only place I buy my dog, Phoebe's food and get her groomed. Phoebs is even on a first name basis in this local gem. Staff is very knowledgeable about all things DOGS!!  They love your baby as much as you love them. Its literally less than a mile from my casa.  Yes, my pup and I are lucky and even spoiled with its location.  Be jealous.  Be very jealous. ;)

This is the best groomer we have ever been to. We take our two dogs and cat here and will not be going anywhere else again. Our cat can have a bit of an attitude but is never scared or tense when she comes/ goes here, so I am certain that she is treated well by the staff. Our dogs are doodles and we have their feet shaved into poodle feet to cut down on mess in the house. The younger one doesn't love having her feet shaved and other groomers have not been able to shave them because she was difficult, Petsburgh was able to shave her feet with no issues. Overall my dogs always look great, better than anywhere else they have gone - and it has been more reasonably cost than anywhere I've been. They are accommodating with my schedule and even send me text updates. I definitely recommend giving them a try!

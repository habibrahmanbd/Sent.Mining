Great Ramen spot.  Clean interior and just the right amount of background music.  Staff here is awesome, I saw one of the guys teaching the girls next to me how to use chopsticks.  Menu is tight and straight to the point - RAMEN.  Pork belly is great and the chef flame torches it to give it the perfect char.  Overall, great Ramen, service, and experience.

I really enjoyed coming here, it located near walnut st which meant parking was difficult. 

What I didn't realized was that hot pots where individualized. They gave a pot over an electric hot plate which you can adjust the temp. They also have hot water on the side in case you run out. Very fulfilling for $15.

It's a small area and they also have a section for you to customize your own sauces.

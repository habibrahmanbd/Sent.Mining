this hawaiian/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii. I ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good. the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets. deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu. The ALOHA spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas..thanks to RUSSEL.

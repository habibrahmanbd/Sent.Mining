Okay, so, we had a full meal here, with drinks, for less than $20. Can somebody say Value?!

We came here for brunch on a Saturday around 10:00 AM, and it was relatively full. We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!

Located right beside the Erindale GO Station in the same plaza as Sushi Tei, Chili Chicken House, and Wonton Chai Noodle (among others), on the northwest corner of Creditview and Burnhamthorpe, and a few minutes away from the Mavis exit of Highway 403, this place really gives you bang for your buck. Plus, the food is delicious, prepared fresh. Overall, a really enjoyable meal. 

Our total with tax was around $18.00. With tip, we paid around $21.00. A great, go-to cheap eat in Mississauga where the food is actually decent! Will be back.

I love chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, so I was looking forward to experiencing the restaurant during my stay.  The first night we ate at the bar and had a blood orange margarita with a mole rim and the citrus chicken quesadillas.  It was so good I did not want to stop eating, but I was stuffed.  On my last day, we had lunch there, also at the bar.  It was happy hour so the drinks were a little less expensive.  I had the spicy shrimp tacos.

Food, drink and service are phenomenal.  Prices are average; not overly pricy, but not cheap.  You are paying for quality in food and service, so just do it.  Go there.  Eat there.

Tuesdays are 30% off seniors 60 and over. That is a huge saving. If I see something a few days before that I like, and is still around Tuesday it's an extra bonus.  You must tell the cashier you are a senior before cashing out, or they  will not apply the discount. Transaction has to be voided and well... so just tell them right away.  I like this location. Some of the house ware merchandise is pricey. It makes no sense and needs to be addressed. Wouldn't it be nice if one day they wold throw in a " free book of your choice " with purchase of $5.00 . Too many books on shelves that don't move.  I see students, seniors, family with children who may be on a budget or getting by,  why not have a  " no tax " day it makes a difference.  Have fun and take some time to sift through the racks .  Some days you win some and other days you don't.

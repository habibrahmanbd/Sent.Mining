I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..

Mom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..

Made a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.

Sat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.

Overall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!! 

Only complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..

I personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood.. 

But I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.

Even though it's not my cup of tea, I believe this place deserves 4 stars

Decided on Valley ENT because my insurance provider covered them and they were conveniently located. I needed a quick appointment and didn't want to wait several weeks. I took a gamble and picked first available, which was Dr. Chuang. After I made my appointment, I began reading reviews on Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang. I couldn't have disagreed more on the negative reviews. Both Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang were professional, courteous, thorough and friendly. I will enthusiastically recommend both to anyone looking for quality healthcare. I strongly endorse them. They were excellent.

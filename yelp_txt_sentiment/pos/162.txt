I have visited this place several times. They have great happy hour prices and their regular menu prices are very reasonable too. Their entrees are big enough to share, my favorite is their fish tacos. They tend to get pretty busy on Friday nights, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait. Overall, thumbs up!

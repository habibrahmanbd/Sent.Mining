I've been in my current house almost 8 years and have had a few issues my ac units. Prior companies gave me the run around and weren't honest or didn't fix my ac's. Found Polar Air through a friend 3 years ago and have been very satisfied since. They have always responded quickly, anytime of the day. Techs were knowledgable, didn't creep my wife out, and I never felt over sold on things. Polar Air is the best ac company I've found in my 15 years of being a homeowner in the Las Vegas valley!

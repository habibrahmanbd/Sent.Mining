First time ever coming here even though I live less than a mile away. I have to admit it was fantastic! I ordered the Surf & Turf taco plate. Both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh. 
I got the Spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious, not dry and over cooked like most places. 
The young man at the register "Chris" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant. I will definitely be coming back to check out the $1.50 tacos on Tuesday.

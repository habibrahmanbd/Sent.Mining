We order out at work every week and got their menu in the mail and gave them a try last week.  Pizza, hoagies, salads and pasta dishes were ordered with no evidence leftover shortly after delivery.  I had pepperoni pizza and it was delicious.  Thinner crust than other places and light on the sauce, how I prefer my pizza.  Coworkers who had other food items enjoyed their lunch too.  Looking forward to trying other menu items!

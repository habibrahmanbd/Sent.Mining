I have been eating warm pies on location and buying frozen pies to eat at home ever since the first location opened. 

I am a huge fan of their savoury pies! I honestly cannot pick a favourite because I like so many of their pies and decide on the flavour based on what I'm craving at the time. I enjoy the braised beef rib, beef 'n beer, butter chicken (slightly spicy), veg-ilicious, pulled pork. The seasonal flavours are great too!

I'd love to try the lobster shrimp, but it's been sold out whenever I visit.

As for the sweet pies, the cheesecake with raspberry is my fave! 

I also enjoy the coleslaw. The dressing is tart and the perfect amount. The dried apricot adds a great texture and sweetness. I just wish the cabbage was chopped more finely. The carrots are julienned, yet the cabbage is chopped in large pieces, which makes for a tough texture.

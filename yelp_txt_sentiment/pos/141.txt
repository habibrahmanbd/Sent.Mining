Dined here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night -- actually sat at the bar with my three fellow diners and had an absolutely amazing evening -- food, wine, service all made for a perfect experience.

Tried almost all the appetizers and 'small plates' and they were exceptional.
Standouts were: almond spread, harcha bread, quinoa salad, beef kefta

Shared a fish tagine for 4 and it was also excellent!

Highly recommend this place - I know we'll be back!

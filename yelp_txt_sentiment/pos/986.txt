I borrowed a friends Costco card with the sole purpose of purchasing the Cackalacky Cheerwine bbq sauce, little did I know I would walk out spending over $100. I love Costco just as much as I love Sams. I am seriously considering getting my own membership to have both. While both sold the same type products, the options did vary at both. Where I found a variation of 1 item at one that the other did have. After walking into Costco i'd felt i'd been missing out on awesome deals.

This resto has "meal of your life" potential! To start, the bread and pesto is to die for. I ordered the half caesar salad, and my loving girlfriend had the half beet salad. Both were nice presentations and incredibly tasty. For main I had the goat cheese tortelli. Will not lie, one of the best meals ever. The duck confit was cooked to perfection. Very tasty and well worth the price. GF had lasagna, and it was just as good as the tortelli. Highly recommend this place...will return!

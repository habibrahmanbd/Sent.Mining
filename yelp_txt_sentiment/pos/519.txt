This place is over the top! The food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in Vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to.

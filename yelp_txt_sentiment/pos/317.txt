After a spontaneous visit to Piccadilly, I am sold on their artisan organic froyo (with vegan options!) I was skeptical, which is why I held out for so long on a visit...but I was very pleased with the overall experience.

The decor is trendy and interesting, it's Cleveland-centric, and they offer great vegan options. When our group entered the store, we were warmly welcomed and given an explanation of how everything worked. It's a per-ounce froyo place with lots of possibilities. I chose the artisan organic tart yogurt and the vegan blueberry...mmm. One thing to note is that because it's vegan (made with coconut milk), it's not as creamy and melts a bit quicker if you're not used to vegan things. Yum. 

They have lots of topping options, along with organic MOCHI and tons of fruit. They also have nutella and flavored bubbles! I usually go with the mochi and fruit with froyo, and all of it was very fresh.

It turned out to be a bit pricy, but I'm willing to pay for it - the whole thing, from the froyo to the overall experience.

I loved the ambiance of this restaurant.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent. We started with the Famous Roy's Hawaiian Martini, Lobster Potstickers for apps, Scallops and Swordfish for our entrees and everything was cooked to perfection.  If you are a dessert lover like I am... especially CAKE, you must try the Pineapple Upside Down Cake served a la mode...SO Good!  This was  my first time, but I will definitely dine at Roy's again!

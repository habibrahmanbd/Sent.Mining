What an incredible experience this was. There is nothing particular special about the neighborhood atmosphere, but don't let that deter you. We were seated on the outside patio which was lovely on a warm summer evening. The service was exceptional as the staff was incredibly kind and attentive, but it was the food that really made this experience. From the crispy shrimp appetizer and beef tartar, to the octopus special and veal flank steak, the food was simply amazing. Unfortunately, we're from the San Francisco area so may not be back any time soon, but if this were in our home town neighborhood, we would come back weekly!

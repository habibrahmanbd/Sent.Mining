Had the occasion over the last few weeks to experience their sports medicine/physical therapy department.  Outstanding.  Drs. Anthony "Tony" Walker and Jennifer Hannon are a great team.  They really know their stuff.

Beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients.  On each appointment we began discussing how the exercises were working, how I was feeling, what is working or not.  Then we would get into planning for that day and going forward.

I was involved in the therapy.  And we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments.

They administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life.  After the therapy has run its course you complete the same survey, so they have a before and after record of your condition.

Impressive and given the people cycling through this practice it was clear that the facility and all the therapists were doing something special.

Good resource for most all of us.

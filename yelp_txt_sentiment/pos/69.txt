These darn Northerners really know how to make some goooood eggplant. I am obsessed, like seriously obsessed with their eggplant minced pork dish. it sounds so simple but never have I had it this good. Everything else on the menu is decent, the dumplings, XLB, noodles, etc., but the eggplant is to die for! Go for the authentic side of the menu avoid the Americanized dishes.

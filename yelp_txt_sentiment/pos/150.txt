Without a doubt,  my favorite Indian restaurant to date. There is a lot of variety, but my favorite dish is the chicken korma. The butter chicken is also fantastic. It is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy. For those of you who like to feel the burn, they have plenty of options to choose from, as well. I recommend the Thali for people who are just starting to explore their Asian culinary senses. Also, if you are a naan connoisseur, you need add Palais d'Ajit to your list.

Don't expect any fancy surroundings. It looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away). The staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow. If you don't like to wait, call ahead and take it home!

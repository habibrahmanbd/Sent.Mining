This is a great steakhouse! We celebrated my birthday here! Started with the calamari which was really good. Didn't expect the twist with the sweet chili sauce. Which it Is tossed in. Ordered the tomahawk ribeye medium plus was PERFECT! Super moist and tender! The best lobster Mac and cheese!! Can't forget about the blueberry lemon drop!!

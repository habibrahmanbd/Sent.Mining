I grade sushi restaurants on 3 factors:
- Quality - Excellent. No fishy smell on my food or in the restaurant. Delicious. Rolls were well made and tasty!
- Quantity - I walked out STUFFED from eating the $9.99 lunch special.
- Price - Can't beat $10 for lunch, especially this much good sushi.

But the takeout side of things was not as good.
The teeny tiny salad had wilted lettuce. The takeout version of the Sakana lunch does not include miso soup, although the price is the same, and they did not include chopsticks, napkins, or soy sauce.

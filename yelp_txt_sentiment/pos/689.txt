This is the only old time boot store around. I walked in there. I was greeted my a white gentleman in this 50's. He was very friendly. He asked me what I was looking for and found me three different pairs of work boots to try on. He sat me down. Measured my foot. Brought out three different pairs of boots. Laced up my boots. Put my foot in the boots with a shoe horn. Then laced up both boots. I walked around and decided on a pair. I Thought this kind of service was gone. RED WINGS IS THE ONLY BOOTS STORE THAT STILL HAS SERVICE THE WAY IT USED TO BE. This place is awesome!! The white gentleman is awesome!! GOOD PRICES,GREAT SERVICE,WELL MADE BOOTS!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.

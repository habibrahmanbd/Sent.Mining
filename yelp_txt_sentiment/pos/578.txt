Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price). I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed. I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin. And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes. Good stuff.

Also a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in.

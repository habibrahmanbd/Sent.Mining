We lived in Mexico for several years so are always looking for authentic restaurants. La taquizza does a good job.  Their menu is diverse and includes many of our favourite dishes you don't typically find in Canada.  The food is much better in house than as take out.  We have ordered many dishes off the menu and love anything carnitas and the fact that they have decent corn tortillas. The huraches are great too. I am a bit biased about the tacos al pastor since I lived in Puebla, but they are still ok. Can't miss the mandatory churros though. They are amazing!

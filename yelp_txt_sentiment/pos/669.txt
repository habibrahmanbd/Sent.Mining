This was soooo good ! The fish was delicious. Make sure you give them your total rewards card for more points. Everything taste really good. If you're Platinum and up you're drinks are included (alcoholic) but you might as well grab drinks off the casino floor 
The ice cream is made in house it's NOT soft serve. There are comfortable booths and tv screens in there. The bathrooms are located OUTSIDE. Ask for directions. It was good. For the 3 of us it was $81 just to give you an idea 
I was too busy stuffing my face to take photos. Sorry !

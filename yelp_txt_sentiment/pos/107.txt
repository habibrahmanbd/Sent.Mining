Right off the bat, I need to tell you that I love thrift store shopping. Adore it. occasionally have sultry dreams about it. Okay, we'll stop there. 

Savers is the heaven and hell of Las Vegas thrift stores. You have to be willing to get dirty, to get on your knees and repent. You have to suffer through repeated disapointments in order to achieve the nirvana of a true thrift store find. 
First trip out - chewed up Barbie dolls and incomplete board games. Second trip - A set of Christmas lights marked for $2 more than at the Walmart they same from. But then, on the third trip back, there it is - the chimera. The unicorn. The 36" 1970's black velvet painting of two tigers in flagrante delicto. The Elvis cookie jar. The wine cooler made out of an abandoned suit of armor. The red leather Michael Jackson Thriller jacket. A bronze toreador sculpture. And it's only $12.99. 
Ah- Thrift-gasm. Thank you Savers. I'll see you next week.

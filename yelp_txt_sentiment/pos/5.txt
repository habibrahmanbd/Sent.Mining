Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. 
I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. 
Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. 
A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! 
Well with it.

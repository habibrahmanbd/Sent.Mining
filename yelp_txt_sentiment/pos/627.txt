PVSEC was amazing when our family dog was attacked by a deer. They took excellent care of our dog and provided constant updates and visits to make us feel as comfortable as possible during a traumatic time. The staff and doctors were wonderful. I was even able to call in the middle of the night and speak to a staff member about how our dog was doing. Everyone clearly loves animals who worked there and made it as easy as possible on our family. They even provided help locating another 24 hour emergency clinic when our dog relapsed a few months later while we were on vacation out of state. Would highly recommend this clinic to care for your furry friend.

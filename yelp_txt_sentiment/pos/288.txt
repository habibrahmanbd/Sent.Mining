I've waited 16 years to get this crazy rachet home tattoo covered up I'm celebrating 10!yrs of marriage and had to get this handled. It had scarring it was bad!! Josh came through like a champ his superrrr cool it was a longgg session but I took it like a G and now I'll be in the Domican Republic celebrating without having to worry about my back.
My tattoo looks amazing doesn't look like a cover up but most important for who ever is reading this... Your in BOMB professional hands the vibe is comfortable and the people are chill. God bless you and I'll be sending you lots of people Thank you Josh!!!!!!!!!!

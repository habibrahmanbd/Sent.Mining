We have been trying Eggplant sandwiches all over the valley because my day loves eggplant.  Delfaco's sandwich on the Italian Hoagie had way way too much bread more bread than eggplant.  The eggplant by itself was very tasty, but get it without so much bread, you will thank me later.  We will be back to try something else.  I went at 11 am on a Saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order.  It is a very crammed space, a little Italian deli in between a Italian grocery store.  The prices for the Italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced.  The espresso is nicely priced at $1.40 for a single shot.

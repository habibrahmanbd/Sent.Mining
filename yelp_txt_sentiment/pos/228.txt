I have a confession to make... I have an obsession with tongue.

That's right folks - tongue. I love it. Name the animal - duck, pig, cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal. (what, were thinking about something else? You guys have dirty minds ;P  !) Being Asian, my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age.

When I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver, yum!), I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.

I was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well, on the Strip, you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.

You can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe! 

My hubby got the pastrami and I ordered the tongue sandwich. Perfection. Really. And not hard on the wallet either which is the best part.

I did try a slice of Boston Creme cake and it is totally junky good.

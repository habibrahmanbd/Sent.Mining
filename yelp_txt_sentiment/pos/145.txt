Around $45 for a dinner on a Friday night.
Snow and Kind crab, caviar, steak tartare, all types of meat and cuts, sushi, soups, Asian cuisine, pastas and pizzas. Literally all you can think about.
Almost everything we tried was really good. 
Their dessert section and flavors are one of the best !

Recommended for sure

Egg-celent! Was so delicious and would definitely recommend it. I gave only 4 stars because I wish they had more options on their menu. I didn't want bread and opted for the salad at no additional cost. Although the salad was good, I'm not too sure about arugula with scrambled eggs and a slice of cheddar cheese.

Out of all the Jersey Mike's locations in Vegas, this is my favorite. I'm always greeted with friendly staff and their Philly cheesesteak sandwich is always on point with fresh ingredients. My husband always orders the #13 and is never disappointed. Anthony is always smiling at the register and Alex does an outstanding job making sandwiches

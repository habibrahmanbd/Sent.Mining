3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird, apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way, I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food.

Snakes and Lattes has great customer service, this is a really important yet often overlooked aspect of any business. They are prompt in replies to emails and try to be as flexible as they can be. I made a reservation two months prior for June 22nd and at the last minute had to change it. They couldn't guarantee I'd get a table, but lo and behold everything worked out. I love that they text you to let you know your table is ready - I really hate getting phone calls.

Food prices are expensive, but with a $5 cover and no time limit I'd be happy to pay their prices. Everyone was really great, even when I was just popping in to buy a game. I love it here and will definitely be back with more people in tow.

Oh and the strawberry cheesecake milkshake is SO DELICIOUS.

My only criticism is they really need to get proper tables for the couch area. It's hard to play a non-board game like Carcassonne the City on tables with slats.

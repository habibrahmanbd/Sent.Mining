I've had the pleasure of dining at the other locations of Yardbird so I was pretty excited to be able to try out their new Vegas location. 

I like it, although it definitely departs from the Southern draw of the other location and that authentic kitchen to table feel. We got the usual deviled eggs, chicken and waffles, and cobbler to finish. Overall the chicken was not as great as the Miami location and the cobbler was a bit disappointing. However, the eggs were delicious and waffles were on point!

I will say it's a pretty solid lunch spot so definitely pay a visit when you have a chance.

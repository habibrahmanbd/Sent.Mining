Amazing! We moved to a new house and wanted to protect it. After researching several security companies I spoke with Steve from Smart Security who came out and looked everything over. He is like a consultant for our security needs because he made sure to tell us what was needed, but he also told us what was not needed so we didn't waste our money. This was invaluable. Then our job was more difficult because of the way the home was designed but Steve put in a lot of time, including on the weekend to make sure it was done right (this included cameras and glass break detection, etc). 

Stop looking around and call them, you will be glad you did.

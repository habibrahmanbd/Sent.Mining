Just got a haircut from Gondola and I am very satisfied and happy with the outcome. Showed the stylist the haircut I wanted and he did it very well. Forgot to ask his name but he is the stylist with shorter hair.  Cheaper than the salon I used to go and I use to pay $50 for just haircut and with Gondola, same satisfaction at a cheaper price. Will definitely come back again.

Giving them 4 stars as stylist keeps on stopping while giving me haircut to pick up the phone since they don't have a receptionist.

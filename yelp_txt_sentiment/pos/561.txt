Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. 
The staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger.
Caution: will smell like BBQ grill after.

Wiki Wiki is like the middle ground from your typical gas station auto wash and full service washes with the personal touch.

You start out by ordering your service at one of 3 electronic kiosks.  Everything is touch screen. They give you 4 choices but then they suggest additional upgrades to your wash.  You pay and then move on to the wash.  Someone assists you in getting your car lined up in the track.  Put your car in neutral and in a few minutes your car moves through the wash and you come out the other end.  

When you come out, you have the option of using one of several free vacuum which are powerful.

This is a great alternative to the full service places.  It's quicker and you don't have to wait for someone to towel dry your car.

Best bean and cheese burrito in town!! Our kids beg us to take them there weekly. My sister used taco dilla's catering for a graduation/birthday party for her kids and they did a faboulos job. The set up was top notch and the food was always well stocked . Their customer service was on point . All of the food was amazing stand outs- steak and blue cheese quesadillas! Yum yum

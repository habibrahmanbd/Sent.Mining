I knew coming here, there would be a long line. We waited about 25 mins which isn't too bad. There is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier.

We got the infamous "slut," Fairfax sandwich and some orange juice. The orange juice taste so good! So refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! The Slut is pretty good, its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip. The sandwiches are amazing and the Fairfax doesn't disappoint. I still think of the bread and how soft it is! 

Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

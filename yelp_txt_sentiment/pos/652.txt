Looking at the bad reviews, I was kind of scared before getting the vehicle. I thought I will keep it on hold to experience it and if something goes bad I would try at other rentals.

But the whole process was so smooth. I booked it through Costco Car Rentals so the rental was bit less and I got a decent rate for insurance.
Reached at terminal-2 parked my personal vehicle and took the shuttle to the Car rentals place.Reached Budget at 9:30AM to pick up the vehicle, there was one guy in the queue.
The rental guy was very friendly and he offered me 3 flavors of the Jeep and he gave me the 2015 model. The vehicle was in excellent condition and make sure you don't mess up with the vehicle while returning.

4 Star because of few issues:
- they never picked up the call before I could get my Jeep.
- Before I got the Jeep, someone had put chocolates inside the cabinet and the Jeep manual was in lot of chocolate !!!! I wanted to know more about the 4W drive but looks like no one knew how to operate it. I googled it  out and found my answers. Yes one lady came and cleaned the chocolates before I got my Jeep.

Yes I am  impressed about the whole process of Budget Sky Harbor.

After getting into an arguement at another Az casino with a fellow BJ player, I've decided that table poker is the game for me.  3 Card Poker specifically!!!   Love going to the Wild Horse Pass casino.  All the table dealers I've dealt with there are very friendly, both when you're winning and losing.  Trust me, I've seen my fair share of "coolers" who have been asshats in other casinos.  The dealer I had this past Friday night was especially helpful to a friend of mine, a newbie to 3 card, and taught her the basics.   

The 27/7 cafe has decent food.  Though I think next time, I'll just order a side of bacon and an order of sourdough toast instead of a club on sourdough.  The bacon they have there...seriously...AWESOME!  

Finally....Many THANKS to Wild Horse Pass for having a $5min 3 card Poker table on Friday night!  And a BIG thank you to the dealer who dealt me the 3 of a kind and the straight flush!  Cha Ching!!  Color up Yo!  :D

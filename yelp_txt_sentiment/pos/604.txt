Had a nice date here with the bae on Friday night.

We ordered a couple of pints and enjoyed the vibe of this place overall.

To share, we decided on the fried jerk chicken wings, which were delicious. Bae ordered the baseball steak and I opted for a soup and salad.

I tried a bite of the steak which was very tasty and the side of smashed/fried red potatoes were oh so good. I enjoyed my french onion soup and arugula salad as well.

I would return if I was in the area again :)

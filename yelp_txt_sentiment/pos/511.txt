Give me someone who can make me laugh... and I'll be your friend for life.

I'm a big fan of the Comedy Zone. They are having a killer year with shows. Kudos to the crew there for bringing in such great talent and big names in 2013.

It's located below the Saloon at the NC Music Factory. Yes, it feels like you are in someone's basement, but not in a "it rubs the lotion on its skin" kind of way.

Drinks are reasonably priced. Bottled water only. The menu is your typical bar food, but pretty decent bar food at that. Service is good. I've yet to have a bad experience.

The venue set up is great. There is seriously not a bad seat in the house. You can pick yours online when you buy tickets. 

The local opener will always be hit or miss. The headliner(s) will be worth the price of admission.

If you're looking for something different to do, I recommend checking the Comedy Zone calendar and catching a show.

My personal must-see list: (I make sure to go every time these guys are in town)

Bill Burr (He sells out pretty much every time. Buy immediately when announced)
Josh Wolf (you know him from Chelsea Lately, Shark After Dark)
Pauly Shore (warning: filthy language)

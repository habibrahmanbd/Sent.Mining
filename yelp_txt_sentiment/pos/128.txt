Gluten free options promised, so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado.   Large portion--very delicious.  5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon. Lots of seating outside on the covered patio.  Their parking fills quickly, but plenty of options on street or at the Municipal Bldg.

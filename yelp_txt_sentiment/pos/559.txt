We are so sad to see Sabrina leave Orange County!!!  We have depended on her for the past 4 years petsitting our huge English Mastiff.  Sabrina has made our lives so much easier to travel with peace of mind knowing that Kali would be well taken care of and even giving up updates and pictures while we were gone.  Do not hesitate to use Sabrina - she is really as fabulous as everyone on this site says.  NO KIDDING!!!  And if she ever comes back to O.C. we will welcome her back with OPEN PAWS!!!

First time in this place. Pretty impressive. I liked the lemon popcorn chicken with green onions..good flavor and sauce. The soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually, I wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy. Bimbap was excellent. Delicious and very comforting. Of course all the sides great as usual with Korean Cuisine. Overall, we were pretty happy. Service was good, even though I've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention. I am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy. Would come back and have a few other things on the menu.

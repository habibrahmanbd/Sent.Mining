A hidden gem! Initially I thought this was a drive thru coffee stand. To my surprise they serve breakfast, lunch dinner and happy hour. An adorable pet friendly patio that was busy what look like with local patrons. Inside tables and bar seating. Cozy fit and counter service for lunch. Check out the unique bathroom. The entire staff was extremely friendly and going the extra mile to make every guest welcome.

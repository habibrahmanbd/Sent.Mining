Love this bubble tea shop! Green grotto has a very nice and comfortable atmosphere and definitely a place where you can relax and have a drink. The drinks here are good and the food as well. They give out free popcorn which is very unique and cool. The service was great and the workers were also very kind. 

This is a great place to go on a small cute date ~ 

I would definitely recommend to a friend!

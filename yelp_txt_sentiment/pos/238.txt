I've never been to Akina for their AYCE dinners, only for their WONDERFULLY priced bento box set lunches.

Their bento boxes are all set at $5.99.  They come with miso soup, salad, and 3 Cali-rolls.  The boxes themselves are large and usually have like 3-4 different things in them (i.e. Tofu, mixed veg, main course, rice).

Value wise, this has got to be one of the best lunches you can get for $5.99.

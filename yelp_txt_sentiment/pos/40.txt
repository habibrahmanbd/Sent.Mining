received a  mailer and thought okay let's go. walked in on a Monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby. how cute however never got her name. looked over menu asked what was good she said the club. so ordered it and  yes it is good. had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center. really felt at ease there and good music playing. will go back again.

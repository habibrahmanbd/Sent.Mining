TOTALLY GAUDY BUT GREAT!
Spent my 26th birthday wknd here.  It also happened to be my first trip to Vegas, despite living in LA since I was 18--imagine that!  Anyhow, we stayed in suite with a step down living room and all the gold in that place made me wear my stunna shades--LOL!!!  Definitely check out the V-Bar.  The drinks are unique and this place is definitely for the 'grown and sexy'.

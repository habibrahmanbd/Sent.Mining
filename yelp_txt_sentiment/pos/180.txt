The challah French toast paired with turkey bacon was a pretty awesome breakfast and I thoroughly enjoyed it; however, I felt the staff was lacking in service. They were very nice, just not very prompt and would disappear for quite some time.  I don't know if it was because a few people called out and they were short-staffed or if one should plan to stay awhile.  The food is very good, though.

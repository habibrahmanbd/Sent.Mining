After spending the day at Woodbine Beach, I was looking for a good burrito place within decent walking distance to share with friends. Luckily, Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk, and it certainly did not disappoint. 

I ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito, complete with everything, short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed, which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although, most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender, and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken, and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice, tangy addition, but not worth the extra cost in my opinion. 

I would drop by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4/5

A must go destination in Phoenix.
Chinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!)
It's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.

If it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!

If you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border/great wall/beach!
(and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)

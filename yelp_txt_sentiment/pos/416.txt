Pretty good for a first time. My UberEATS delivery experience was mediocre but the pizza was one of the best I've tried so far. 

I ordered the Mediterranean and it had a lot of flavor from all the different veggies and spices. My only complaint is: the crust was a bit dry, a little more olive oil wouldn't have hurt. 

I'm very captious about my pizza, but I honestly state I would order another one again in the future.

Id give a 3.5 closer to a 4.
Customer service is great, i called in my order and had my bf pick it up. Was very easy to order no issues straight to the point. Also when my bf picked up the food he told me how nice they were which is another plus. 
The food is typical western chinese food. The one thing i loved mosy was the chicken balls was actually more chicken then dough. When does that ever happen lol. 
We also got fried chicken wings also greasy and yummy . Just what i wanted fresh/crispy.
Chicken fried rice was as expected no complaints.
Lastly the chilli chicken , which is why i said 3.5 and not 4. It was full of veggies barely any meat. Also was not spicey at all. But i guess its western chinese food and they know we cant handle spice lol

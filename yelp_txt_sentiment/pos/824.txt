They have organic items. I like that there is an organic produce section with organic veg and fruits. They sell locally grown sprouts. I like the bulk nut dispensers where there are some organic nut choices. They have a large selection of various ethnic foods and a section of Amy's organic frozen foods. They have canned organic beans. The store is big and beautiful. The staff is friendly and helpful. The parking lot is easy. As far as crime goes: I have not seen any. I know that recently a wanted man was across the street and apprehended on East Overlook , but if I didn't know that, I would not have seen it. The feeling is a nice grocery store.

Bruh, I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.

This place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small, old, and needs remodeled,  but the wings are still great!

They get crispy right.  And, the service was nice too.

The Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.

Also, get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many, but man they are good.

In short, take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service.

Went here on new years day to grab a burger. Got in before the OSU game started. Tasty $5 cocktails (in pint glasses, mind you) and good burgers. The fries have large grain salt and were well prepared. I had the Oh Cheesus, which is a burger to be reckoned with. Seems a bit like a rip off from Melt but I didn't care, it's a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger) 


...I made it healthier by adding spinach on top. Basically health food at that point.

I'll be back!

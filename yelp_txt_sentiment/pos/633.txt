Great ambiance, great food, although their policy of no reservations can be a drag.
Great place for ribs...they are so tender they fall off the bone. I always order the Louisiana chicken.....a flattened chicken breast smothered with grilled vegetables and goat cheese. Goat cheese is like bacon...it just makes everything better.
Also try their artichoke dip as an appetizer...it is the best out there.
On our last visit ( less than a week ago) ,their baked beans were different...hopefully it was just a hiccup because they are usually incredible.
Service is always excellent and the prices are reasonable considering portion size.

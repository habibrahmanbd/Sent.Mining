One word:  Amazing!!  Real southern food - will NOT disappoint.  And I know southern!  Chef Austin took great care of our group for my Bday celebration in Vegas. Not easy to please everyone at a large table of picky eaters looking for a taste of home!  Fried chicken was perfection - seasoned so well!  Can't wait to return.

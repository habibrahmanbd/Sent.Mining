Found this place on Yelp and we couldn't have agreed more with the reviews. This is a tiny hole in the wall next to an asian massage "R&T". I could have driven by this place hundreds of times and never seen it. Ignore the tacky decor, because this place has some of the best carne asada in Phoenix. Start with the chips and salsa and you will see that this isn't your regular taco shop. 

We tried the carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito and the chips and guacamole. All delicious. The carne asada is tender and full of flavor. Guacamole and salsas are so fresh and tasty that you will run thru your chips in no time. 

We have been to Sonora Grill now a few times and I am just getting around to my review. I think that says it all. Sonora Grill is a must!

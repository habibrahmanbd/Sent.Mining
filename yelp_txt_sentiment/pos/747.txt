My husband and I stopped in to Guitar Center on a Saturday afternoon in search of a keyboard. I'm a vocalist, but I needed something simple and affordable to help me in my practicing. 

When we arrived I saw it was quite busy inside. Employees were very busy running around everywhere to help different customers. I was actually a little happy about this because I didn't want to be pressured by someone into buying a fancier keyboard than I needed. We were able to browse the selection, try different options, and decide on our own. After making our choice I tracked down an employee at the front desk (Tyler) who came and helped us right away. He asked if we need a power source, and I'm thankful he did, because that's something I didn't think about. He tracked down what we needed and checked us out. He asked if we wanted a warranty, and he was able to answer all my questions about it without pressuring me. 

Tyler was super helpful, professional, and efficient, and I'm thankful he was the one to help us. We were very satisfied with our experience and will definitely be back to this location for our future music needs!

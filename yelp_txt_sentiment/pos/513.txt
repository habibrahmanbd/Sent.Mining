The reason I did not rate a 5 is because the staff is not the best with designs. I like to have designs on my nails and they were very hesitant to do any of the ones I wanted. They ended up doing a Hawaiian flower on my toes. Its was ok but not the best. 

I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the salon. They have a large polish selection. My nails have lasted a long time and that means a lot to me. 

They were very friendly and humorous there! They all used English talking to patrons and with each other, which was great! 

I think the prices were great for the Waxhaw area. I paid $57 (without tip) for a full set French manicure with sparkles, and pedicure with design. I used to pay $75 for the same service at my last salon. 

I will definitely go here again. I would recommend making an appointment. It was a Saturday when I went and they were turning people away.

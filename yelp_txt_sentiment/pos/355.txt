Got a chance to check out this spot while catching up with a business contact for coffee.  The gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings .  The coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option.  

I had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant, it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.  I now look forward to trying this place out later in the day.

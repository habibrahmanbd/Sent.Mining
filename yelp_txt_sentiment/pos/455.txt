This is just a great little find with great N'Orleans-style food. Had the blackened trout. Mr. Bill had crayfish. Shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. I normally don't care for collard greens, but they were delicious. You have to try the bread pudding, if you have room. Pleasant staff. Good food. What more can you ask for! Oh, yeah, great variety of libations. Thank you for a new Tega Cay eatery that's good!!

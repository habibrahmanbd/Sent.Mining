My family and I have been visiting this location since it opened. Can't really remember the year now. 

Although several of the reviews have to do with bad customer service, I have found that it's definitely a staff turnaround issue. We go often during the summers, and well, all year round actually. LoL. It's never too cold to get ice cream in AZ, am I RIGHT?????

Anywho, the ice cream is always yummy and the experience of the kids being able to run back and forth AND BACK AND FORTH trying new flavors or deciding which one to pick It's always fun!  

Sadly, the smiling faces might not always be there, but thankfully, we always have a smile on OUR FACE that transfers to them weather the staff likes it or not. LoL

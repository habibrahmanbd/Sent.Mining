A local favorite, this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint.  I orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast.  The food was cooked to order- hot, tasty and the bacon was thick, crisp and flavorful, just like I hoped it would be. 

The waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us.  They chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home.

One reminder if you go..... bring cash.  No crest or debit cards taken here!

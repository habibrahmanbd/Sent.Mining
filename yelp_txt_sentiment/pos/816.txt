My stylist was very nice, and overall I was mostly happy with my experience. I used a Groupon and it wasn't stated there would be an additional fee for color for long hair. They made it up with a conditioning treatment which was great and I appreciate the offer. My stylist knew curly hair when I asked about it which was great because many salons don't and create huge issues. I think my questions made her a bit cautious though as the overall length was left a bit longer than I'd intended. The layers and thinning were done well though. Through no fault of their own they lost power halfway through the session. I chose to leave with my style half done because it felt awkward sitting around to see if it would come on, but they were very nice about it. I was offered something to drink several times. Overall I'd return which is a lot coming from me about a hair salon

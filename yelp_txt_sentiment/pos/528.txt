Excellent for Take-out or Delivery.

The food is authentic. The ingredients are incredibly fresh - a necessity in Thai cuisine.

The pad thai is perfect, the green and red curries are consistent and delicious. 

Eating in, however, avoid it! The decor is dated and tacky, not a pleasant environment to dine, although the servers are all pleasant.
